Welcome to a revitalised journey into the heart of *The Secret Garden*, Frances Hodgson Burnett’s cherished tale that has captivated readers for over a century. Burnett, a prolific and celebrated author of children’s literature, gifted the world with stories brimming with hope, transformation, and the enduring power of nature. *The Secret Garden*, perhaps her most beloved work, stands as a testament to her skill in weaving together profound themes of healing, renewal, and the interconnectedness of all living things.

This adaptation is born from a deep respect for Burnett’s original vision and a desire to share its magic with a new generation. While the language of classic literature can sometimes present a barrier, the essence of a great story transcends time. This edition seeks to gently bridge that gap, offering a version that is both accessible and faithful to the spirit of Burnett’s narrative. Our goal is simple: to unlock the garden gate for every reader, regardless of their familiarity with classic texts.

Within these pages, you’ll find the story of Mary Lennox, a spoiled and neglected young girl whose life is forever changed by the discovery of a hidden garden on the Yorkshire moors. As Mary tends to the neglected plants, she also cultivates within herself a newfound sense of purpose and connection. Alongside her cousin Colin, who suffers from a debilitating illness and a belief in his own weakness, and Dickon, a boy deeply attuned to the natural world, Mary learns the transformative power of nature, friendship, and self-belief.

The themes explored in *The Secret Garden* resonate deeply even today. In a world increasingly disconnected from nature, the story reminds us of the importance of our relationship with the environment and the healing power of spending time outdoors. The themes of overcoming adversity, challenging limiting beliefs, and finding joy in simple things are as relevant now as they were when the book was first published. It's a gentle nudge to seek out the hidden beauty within ourselves and the world around us.

This unique edition offers a special opportunity to engage with the story in multiple ways. The inclusion of abridged French versions – one with a helpful vocabulary table – alongside the abridged English text, allows readers to explore the narrative through different linguistic lenses. Icons guide you seamlessly between these versions, offering a comparative reading experience that enhances comprehension and appreciation. This integrated approach aims to make the story even more accessible and engaging for language learners and those who simply enjoy exploring literature in multiple languages.

It is our hope that this adaptation will not only introduce you to the enchanting world of *The Secret Garden* but also inspire you to seek out your own secret garden – a place of healing, growth, and wonder – wherever you may find it. May this journey be as transformative for you as the garden was for Mary, Colin, and Dickon.
