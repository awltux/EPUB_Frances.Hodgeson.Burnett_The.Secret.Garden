## CHAPTER 14
### A Young Rajah
The morning arrived, hidden in mist, with rain still lashing against the windows. Martha was too busy for a chat, but in the afternoon, Mary asked her to sit down in the nursery.

"What's up with you?" Martha asked, noticing Mary's serious face. "You look like you've got something to say."

"I know what the crying is," Mary declared.

Martha dropped her knitting, eyes wide with surprise. "You do? Never!"

"I heard it last night," Mary continued. "I got up and found Colin."

Martha's face turned red with fear. "Oh, Miss Mary! You shouldn't have! I'll get in trouble. I never told you anything about him."

"You won't lose your job," Mary reassured her. "He was happy I came. We talked, and he said he was glad."

"Was he?" Martha cried. "Are you sure? He can be awful when he's upset. A big lad to cry, but he'll scream just to scare us. He knows we have to do what he says."

"He wasn't upset," Mary insisted. "I asked if I should leave, but he made me stay. He asked questions, and I told him about India, the robin, and gardens. He showed me his mother's picture. I even sang him to sleep."

Martha gasped. "I can hardly believe it! You walked into a lion's den. Usually, he throws a tantrum and wakes the whole house. He won't let strangers look at him."

"He let me look at him. We just stared!" Mary replied.

"I don't know what to do!" Martha fretted. "If Mrs. Medlock finds out, she'll think I told you, and I'll be sent home."

"He's not telling Mrs. Medlock. It's a secret, for now," Mary said firmly. "And he says everyone has to do what he wants."

"Aye, that's true," Martha sighed.

"He says Mrs. Medlock must. And he wants me to visit him every day. You have to tell me when he wants me."

"Me?" Martha exclaimed. "I'll lose my place!"

"Not if you're doing what he wants, and everyone has to obey him," Mary argued.

"Are you saying," Martha asked, eyes wide, "that he was nice to you?"

"I think he almost liked me," Mary said.

"Then you must have bewitched him!" Martha decided.

"Do you mean Magic?" Mary asked. "I've heard of Magic in India, but I can't do it. I just went into his room, and surprised to see him, stared. He stared back, and we didn't know each other. We started asking questions, and when I asked if I should leave, he said no."

"The world's ending!" Martha gasped.

"What's wrong with him?" Mary asked.

"Nobody knows for sure," Martha replied. "His Father went mad when he was born. The doctors thought he'd have to be put away. It was because his Mother died. He wouldn't even look at the baby. He said he'd be another hunchback like himself and should just die."

"Is Colin a hunchback?" Mary asked. "He didn't look like one."

"Not yet," Martha said. "But he started badly. They were afraid his back was weak and kept him lying down. He wore a brace, but it made him ill. Then a doctor told them to take it off. He said there was too much medicine and too much letting him have his own way."

"He's a spoiled boy," Mary said.

"The worst ever!" Martha agreed. "He's been ill a lot. Coughs and colds nearly killed him twice. Once he had rheumatic fever. Mrs. Medlock thought he was going to die and said it was best for everyone. He heard her and told her to give him water and be quiet."

"Do you think he will die?" Mary asked.

"Mother says any child who gets no fresh air and does nothing but lie on his back and take medicine will die. He's weak and hates going outside."

Mary looked at the fire. "I wonder if going out into a garden and watching things grow would help him. It helped me."

"Once they took him out where the roses are," Martha said, "and he started sneezing and said he had 'rose cold'. A gardener looked at him, and he threw a tantrum, saying he was staring because he was going to be a hunchback. He cried himself into a fever."

"If he gets angry at me, I'll never see him again," Mary said.

"He'll have you if he wants you," Martha said.

A bell rang, and Martha rolled up her knitting. "The nurse probably wants me to stay with him. I hope he's in a good mood."

Ten minutes later, she returned, puzzled. "You have bewitched him! He's on his sofa with his picture books. He told the nurse to leave him alone until six o'clock. I'm to wait next door. As soon as she left, he called me and said, 'I want Mary Lennox to come and talk to me, and don't tell anyone.' You'd better go quickly."

Mary was happy to go. She wanted to see Dickon more, but she also wanted to see Colin.

There was a bright fire in his room. In the daylight, it was beautiful, with rich colours in the rugs, hangings, pictures, and books. Colin, in a velvet dressing gown, sat against a big cushion, a red spot on each cheek.

"Come in," he said. "I've been thinking about you all morning."

"I've been thinking about you too," Mary answered. "Martha is scared. She thinks Mrs. Medlock will think she told me about you, and she'll be sent away."

He frowned. "Tell her to come here."

Mary brought Martha back, who was shaking. Colin was still frowning.

"Do you have to do what I please?" he demanded.

"I have to do what you please, sir," Martha stammered.

"Does Medlock have to do what I please?"

"Everyone has to, sir," Martha said.

"Well, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me, how can Medlock send you away if she finds out?"

"Please don't let her, sir," Martha begged.

"I'll send her away if she dares to say a word," Colin said grandly. "She wouldn't like that."

"Thank you, sir," Martha said, curtseying. "I want to do my duty, sir."

"What I want is your duty," Colin said. "I'll take care of you. Now go."

When Martha left, Mary stared at Colin, wondering.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" he asked. "What are you thinking about?"

"Two things."

"What are they? Sit down and tell me."

"Once in India, I saw a boy who was a Rajah," Mary said, sitting on the stool. "He had rubies and emeralds all over him. He spoke to his people like you spoke to Martha. Everyone had to do everything he told them immediately."

"I'll make you tell me about Rajahs later," he said, "but what's the second thing?"

"I was thinking how different you are from Dickon," Mary said.

"Who is Dickon? What a queer name!"

She decided to tell him, without mentioning the secret garden. She liked hearing Martha talk about him and wanted to talk about him too.

"He's Martha's brother, twelve years old," she explained. "He's like no one else. He can charm foxes, squirrels, and birds, like the natives in India charm snakes. He plays a soft tune on a pipe, and they come and listen."

Colin pulled a big book towards him. "There's a snake-charmer in this!"

It was a beautiful book with coloured pictures. "Can he do that?" he asked eagerly, pointing to a picture.

"He played on his pipe, and they listened," Mary explained. "He doesn't call it Magic. He says it's because he lives on the moor and knows their ways. He feels like a bird or a rabbit himself. I think he asked the robin questions. They seemed to talk to each other in soft chirps."

Colin lay back, eyes wide, cheeks burning. "Tell me more about him."

"He knows about eggs and nests," Mary continued. "And where foxes, badgers, and otters live. He keeps them secret so other boys won't find them. He knows about everything that grows or lives on the moor."

"Does he like the moor?" Colin asked. "How can he? It's so bare and dreary."

"It's the most beautiful place," Mary protested. "Thousands of things grow there, and thousands of creatures are busy building nests and making holes. It's their world."

"How do you know all that?" Colin asked, turning to look at her.

"I've never really been there," Mary realised. "I only drove over it in the dark. I thought it was awful. Martha told me about it first, then Dickon. When Dickon talks about it, you feel like you see and hear everything and you're standing in the heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey."

"You never see anything if you're ill," Colin said. He sounded like he was listening to a new sound in the distance.

"You can't if you stay in a room," Mary said.

"I couldn't go on the moor," he said resentfully.

Mary was silent, then said something bold. "You might—sometime."

He moved as if startled. "Go on the moor? How could I? I'm going to die."

"How do you know?" Mary asked, unsympathetically. She didn't like him talking about dying. She felt like he was boasting.

"I've heard it forever," he answered crossly. "They're always whispering about it. They wish I would, too."

Mary felt contrary. "If they wished I would, I wouldn't. Who wishes you would?"

"The servants—and Dr. Craven, because he would get Misselthwaite and be rich. He doesn't say it, but he looks cheerful when I'm worse. I think Father wishes it, too."

"I don't believe he does," Mary said stubbornly.

Colin looked at her again. "Don't you?"

He lay back, thinking. There was a long silence. They were both thinking strange things.

"I like the doctor from London, because he made them take the iron thing off," Mary said. "Did he say you were going to die?"

"No."

"What did he say?"

"He didn't whisper," Colin answered. "He said, 'The lad might live if he made up his mind to it. Put him in the mood.' He sounded angry."

"I know who would put you in the mood," Mary said. "Dickon would. He's always talking about live things, not dead things or ill things. He's always looking up at the sky to watch birds or down at the earth to see things growing. He has wide blue eyes and a big laugh, and his cheeks are as red as cherries."

She pulled her stool closer. "Don't let's talk about dying; I don't like it. Let's talk about living. Let's talk about Dickon. Then we'll look at your pictures."

It was the best thing she could have said. Talking about Dickon meant talking about the moor, the cottage, and the fourteen people who lived on sixteen shillings a week. And about Dickon's mother, the skipping rope, the sun on the moor, and pale green shoots coming out of the earth. It was so alive that Mary talked more than ever, and Colin talked and listened as he never had before. They laughed over nothing, like children do when they're happy. They made as much noise as two ordinary ten-year-olds, not a hard, unloving girl and a sickly boy who thought he was going to die.

They had so much fun that they forgot the pictures and the time. They were laughing loudly over Ben Weatherstaff and his robin when Colin suddenly remembered something.

"We've never once thought of something," he said. "We're cousins."

It was so strange that they had talked so much and never remembered this that they laughed even more. In the middle of the fun, Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock walked in.

Dr. Craven was alarmed, and Mrs. Medlock almost fell back.

"Good Lord!" Mrs. Medlock exclaimed.

"What is this?" Dr. Craven said. "What does it mean?"

Mary remembered the boy Rajah. Colin answered as if the doctor's alarm and Mrs. Medlock's terror were unimportant.

"This is my cousin, Mary Lennox," he said. "I asked her to come and talk to me. I like her. She must come and talk to me whenever I send for her."

Dr. Craven turned to Mrs. Medlock reproachfully.

"I don't know how it happened," she panted. "No servant would dare to talk—they have their orders."

"Nobody told her anything," Colin said. "She heard me crying and found me herself. I'm glad she came. Don't be silly, Medlock."

Mary saw that Dr. Craven didn't look pleased, but he didn't dare argue. He sat by Colin and felt his pulse.

"There's been too much excitement. Excitement isn't good for you," he said.

"I'd be excited if she stayed away," Colin answered, eyes sparkling. "I'm better. She makes me better. The nurse must bring up her tea with mine. We'll have tea together."

Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked troubled, but there was nothing to be done.

"He does look better, sir," Mrs. Medlock said. "But he looked better this morning before she came into the room."

"She came into the room last night. She stayed with me and sang a song to me, and it made me sleep," Colin said. "I was better when I woke up. I wanted breakfast. I want tea now. Tell nurse, Medlock."

Dr. Craven didn't stay long. He talked to the nurse and warned Colin not to talk too much or forget that he was ill.

Colin looked fretful and kept his eyes fixed on Dr. Craven's face.

"I want to forget it," he said at last. "She makes me forget it. That's why I want her."

Dr. Craven didn't look happy as he left. He glanced at Mary. She had become stiff and silent again, and he couldn't see the attraction. The boy did look brighter, though, and he sighed as he went down the corridor.

"They're always wanting me to eat things when I don't want to," Colin said as the nurse brought in the tea. "Now, if you'll eat, I will. Those muffins look nice and hot. Tell me about Rajahs."
