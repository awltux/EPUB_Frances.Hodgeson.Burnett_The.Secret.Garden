## CHAPTER 21
### Ben Weatherstaff
It felt like they could live forever in that hidden garden. The afternoon sun made everything perfect, especially for Colin. Dickon, usually full of words, stood still, shaking his head in wonder. “Eh! It is grand,” he said, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen one as grand as this.”

“It is a grand one,” said Mary, happy for once.

Colin, dreamy, asked, “Do you think it was made like this just for me?”

They sat under a plum tree covered in white blossoms and buzzing with bees. Mary and Dickon worked quietly, showing Colin buds and twigs. Dickon pushed Colin’s chair around the garden, stopping to show him the wonders of the earth and trees.

“I wonder if we’ll see the robin?” Colin asked.

“You’ll see him soon enough,” Dickon replied. “He’ll be so busy feeding his chicks, he won’t know what day it is.” He described the robin's frantic work, making them laugh, remembering they had to be quiet.

The afternoon was filled with new things, and the sunshine grew warmer. 

The robin flew past with something in its beak. “Look! The robin!”, Dickon remarked. 

Colin laughed. “He’s taking tea to his wife. I think I’d like some tea myself. Have one of the servants bring a basket to the rhododendron walk,” he said. “Then you and Dickon can bring it here.”

They were soon enjoying tea and toast on the grass. Even the birds joined in, looking for crumbs.

As the afternoon ended, Colin said, “I don’t want it to end, but I’ll come back tomorrow.”

“You’ll get plenty of fresh air,” said Mary.

“I’m going to see everything grow here. I’m going to grow here myself.”

“That you will,” said Dickon. “You’ll be walking about and digging like other folk soon.”

Colin blushed. “Walk? Dig? Will I?”

Dickon was careful. "For sure you will. You've got legs, same as anyone."

Mary was worried until Colin said, “Nothing’s really wrong with them, but they’re so thin and weak. They shake so I’m afraid to stand.”

“When you stop being afraid, you’ll stand,” Dickon said. “And you’ll stop being afraid soon.”

“Will I?” Colin wondered.

Everything was quiet as the sun set. Then, Colin whispered, “Who is that man?”

Dickon and Mary jumped up. “Man!”

Colin pointed to the wall. “Look!”

Ben Weatherstaff’s angry face glared at them from the top of a ladder. He shook his fist at Mary.

“I never liked you!” he shouted. “Always asking questions and poking your nose where it wasn’t wanted. If it hadn’t been for the robin…”

“Ben Weatherstaff,” Mary called, “The robin showed me the way!”

Ben was even angrier. “You young bad one! Blaming a robin! How did you get in?”

“The robin showed me,” she insisted. “I can’t tell you while you’re shaking your fist.”

He stopped, staring at something behind her.

Colin had been silent, but now he ordered, “Wheel me over there! Right in front of him!”

Ben Weatherstaff saw a wheeled chair with a young Rajah, Colin, staring at him with commanding eyes.

“Do you know who I am?” Colin demanded.

Ben stared, speechless.

“Do you know who I am?” Colin repeated. “Answer!”

Ben touched his face, then said in a shaky voice, “Who you are? Yes, I do, with your mother’s eyes staring at me. Lord knows how you got here. But you’re the poor cripple.”

Colin’s face turned red. “I’m not a cripple!”

“He’s not!” Mary shouted. “He doesn’t have a lump! I looked!”

Ben touched his face again, shaking. “You haven’t got a crooked back?”

“No!” Colin shouted.

“You haven’t got crooked legs?” Ben asked.

Colin was furious. He had never been accused of crooked legs. He felt a new strength.

“Come here!” he shouted to Dickon, and began to pull off his blankets. “Come here! This minute!”

Dickon was there at once. Mary gasped.

“He can do it! He can do it!” she whispered.

Dickon held Colin’s arm, and Colin’s thin legs touched the grass. He stood upright, as straight as an arrow, his eyes flashing.

“Look at me!” he shouted at Ben Weatherstaff. “Just look at me!”

“He’s as straight as I am!” Dickon cried.

Ben began to cry, striking his hands together.

“Eh! The lies people tell! You’re thin, but there’s nothing wrong with you. You’ll be a man yet. God bless you!”

Dickon held Colin, but Colin stood tall, looking at Ben.

“I’m your master when my father is away. And you will obey me. This is my garden. Don’t say a word about it! Get down from that ladder and go to the Long Walk. Miss Mary will meet you and bring you here. I want to talk to you. We didn’t want you, but now you’ll be part of the secret. Be quick!”

Ben’s face was wet with tears. He couldn’t stop looking at Colin.

“Eh! Lad,” he whispered. Then, remembering himself, he touched his hat and said, “Yes, sir! Yes, sir!” and disappeared down the ladder.
