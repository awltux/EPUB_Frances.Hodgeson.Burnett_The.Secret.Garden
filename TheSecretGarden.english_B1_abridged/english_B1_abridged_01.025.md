## CHAPTER 25
### The Curtain
The secret garden exploded with life each day. In the robin’s nest, eggs nestled, warmed by the mother bird's feathers. The robin and his partner were alert. Dickon kept his distance, trusting the garden's peace. They sensed everything in the garden understood how precious the eggs were, and how important it was to protect them.

The robin warily watched Mary and Colin. He trusted Dickon instantly, seeing him as a robin without feathers, speaking the bird language fluently. Dickon’s human words didn’t matter; he spoke robin to the robin, the robin understood.

The boy, Colin, arrived in a wheeled contraption, covered in animal skins. He moved strangely, needing help. The robin, hidden, watched him closely, wondering if he was about to pounce like a cat. But then the robin understood.

When Colin started walking, the robin relaxed, thinking back to his own first attempts at flying. Colin was learning to walk again, and soon he was moving with ease, joining the others in their garden activities.

One rainy morning, Colin, restless indoors, said, "Now I am a real boy, my body is full of Magic and I can't keep still."

Mary had an idea. "Do you know there are near one hundred rooms in this house that no one ever goes into," said Mary. "Suppose we go and look at them."

Colin’s eyes lit up. "Ring the bell," he said.

Soon, they were exploring the unused parts of the house. John, the footman, wheeled Colin as far as the picture gallery and then left them alone. They ran through the galleries, doing exercises and examining old portraits.

"All these," said Colin, "must be my relations. She looks rather like you, Mary."

They found the Indian room, played with ivory elephants, and discovered forgotten corridors and staircases. It felt like they were miles away from everyone else in the house.

"I'm glad we came," Colin said. "We will ramble about every rainy day."

They enjoyed their adventure so much that their appetites returned. The nurse, seeing the empty plates, told the cook, "This is a house of mystery, and those two children are the greatest mysteries in it."

That afternoon, Mary noticed the curtain across the picture beside Colin's bed was open. "I am going to keep it like that," said Colin, "because it doesn’t make me angry any more to see her laughing."

"You are so like her now," said Mary, "that sometimes I think perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy."

"If I were her ghost—my father would be fond of me," he said.

"Do you want him to be fond of you?" inquired Mary.

"I used to hate it because he was not fond of me. If he grew fond of me I think I should tell him about the Magic. It might make him more cheerful.”
