## CHAPTER 24
### Let Them Laugh
Dickon had his own garden near his family's cottage, surrounded by a low stone wall. He spent hours there, growing vegetables and herbs, helped by his animal friends. Mrs Sowerby said anything grew well for Dickon, his vegetables bigger and tastier than anyone else's.

She often sat on the wall in the evenings, listening to Dickon's stories about his day. The garden wasn't just vegetables; Dickon had planted flowers too, like mignonette, pinks and pansies, and filled the wall's cracks with moorland plants. He said the secret was to be friends with the plants, giving them water and food when they needed it.

Mrs Sowerby learnt about Misselthwaite Manor in these twilight talks. At first, she only heard that Colin enjoyed going outside with Mary. But soon, the children decided she could know their secret. One evening, Dickon told her everything: the buried key, the robin, the secret garden, and Mary's plan. He described Colin's introduction to the garden, Ben Weatherstaff's surprise, and Colin's sudden strength.

"My word!" Mrs. Sowerby exclaimed. "That little lass has saved him! Standing on his feet! And we thought he was weak." She asked lots of questions, her eyes thoughtful. "What do they think at the Manor, with him so well?"

"They don't know what to think," Dickon replied. "His face is changing, filling out. But he still complains," he added with a grin.

"Why?" Mrs Sowerby asked.

Dickon chuckled. "To stop them guessing. If the doctor knew he could stand, he'd tell Mr. Craven. Colin wants to show his father himself. So, he and Mary groan and fret sometimes, just to trick people."

Mrs. Sowerby laughed. "Those two are enjoying themselves! What do they do, Dickon?"

Dickon explained how Colin was carried to his chair each time he went out, complaining to the footman. He pretended to be helpless until they were out of sight. "He and Mary laugh until they can't breathe! They hide their faces in the cushions so no one hears."

"The more they laugh, the better!" Mrs. Sowerby said. "Healthy laughing is better than medicine. They'll get plump!"

"They are getting plump," Dickon agreed. "They're so hungry! Colin says if he asks for more food, people will know he's not ill. Mary offers him her share, but he says they must both get fat together."

Mrs. Sowerby laughed. "I know how to help! You can take them fresh milk and bread in the mornings. That will keep them going until lunchtime."

"What a wonder you are!" Dickon said. "They were worried yesterday about ordering more food."

"They are growing fast," Mrs Sowerby said. "They need food!" She smiled. "They are enjoying themselves."

She was right. Colin and Mary loved their "play acting". The nurse and Dr. Craven had made them realise they needed to be careful.

"Your appetite is improving, Master Colin," the nurse had said.

"Things don't disagree with me so often now," Colin replied, remembering he shouldn't seem too well. "It's the fresh air."

"Perhaps," the nurse said, looking puzzled. "I must talk to Dr. Craven."

"How she stared!" Mary said. "As if she suspected something."

"No one must find out yet," Colin said.

Dr. Craven also seemed confused. "You spend a lot of time in the garden," he said. "Where do you go?"

"I won't tell anyone," Colin answered. "I go where I like. I won't be watched!"

"You seem to be out all day, but it hasn't harmed you. You eat much more."

"Perhaps," Colin said, "perhaps it is an unnatural appetite."

"I don't think so. You are gaining weight and your colour is better."

"Perhaps I am bloated and feverish," Colin said sadly. "People who are dying are often different."

Dr. Craven felt his arm. "You are not feverish. If we keep this up, we won't talk about dying. Your father will be happy."

"I won't have him told!" Colin cried. "He'll be disappointed if I get worse. I might have a fever tonight! I hate being written about!"

"Hush!" Dr. Craven said. "Nothing will be written without your permission." He warned the nurse not to mention it. "The boy is much better," he said. "But he excites himself easily."

Mary and Colin were worried. They planned their "play acting".

"I might need to have a tantrum," Colin said. "I don't want to, but if they talk about writing to my father, I will have to."

He decided to eat less, as a sick boy should, but he couldn't resist the breakfast of bread, butter, eggs, jam and cream. Mary ate with him, and they looked at each other in despair.

"We'll have to eat it all," Colin would say. "We can send away some lunch and dinner." But they never did.

"I wish the ham was thicker," Colin commented after lunch one day, "and one muffin isn't enough." 

"It's enough for someone who is going to die," Mary said, "but not for someone who is going to live!"

One morning, Dickon brought two pails: one with milk and cream, the other with warm currant buns. They were so happy! What a wonderful idea from Mrs. Sowerby!

"Magic is in her, like in Dickon," Colin said. "She thinks of nice things to do. Tell her we are grateful!"

He started using grown-up words. "Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme." Then he ate the buns and drank the milk like any hungry boy.

This happened every day and they quickly realised Mrs. Sowerby had many people to feed, so they offered to pay for the food.

Dickon found a place in the woods to build a small oven and roast potatoes and eggs. They could eat as much as they liked without feeling guilty.

Every morning, the Magic was worked under the plum tree. Colin walked more each day, growing stronger. His belief in the Magic grew too but it was Dickon that showed him the best things.

"Yesterday," Dickon said, "I saw Bob Haworth in Thwaite. He's the strongest man on the moor. I asked him how he got so strong. He said a man in a show taught him exercises for his arms and legs."

Colin was excited. "Can you show me?"

"Yes," Dickon said. "But do them gently, and rest."

Dickon showed him the exercises. Colin watched, amazed. He did a few sitting down, then standing up. Mary joined in.

From then on, the exercises were part of their day, along with the Magic. They grew stronger each time. They ate so much that they needed Mrs. Sowerby's food to keep them going.

"They are eating next to nothing," the nurse said. "They'll starve! And yet, look at them."

"They're a pair of young devils!" Mrs. Medlock said. "One day they eat everything, the next they refuse it. Cook is upset."

Dr. Craven looked at Colin. He had been away for two weeks. Colin's skin was rosy, his eyes were clear, and his face had filled out. His hair looked healthy. He looked nothing like an invalid. Dr. Craven held his chin.

"I hear you are not eating," he said. "You will lose what you have gained. You ate well before."

"I told you it was an unnatural appetite," Colin answered.

Mary made a strange noise, trying not to laugh.

"What's the matter?" Dr. Craven asked.

"It was between a sneeze and a cough," Mary said.

"I couldn't stop myself," she told Colin later. "I remembered that last potato you ate!"

"Is there any way they can get food secretly?" Dr. Craven asked Mrs. Medlock.

"No, unless they dig it up! They stay outside and see no one else. And they can ask for anything they want."

"Well," Dr. Craven said, "if going without food agrees with them, we won't worry. The boy is a new person."

"So is the girl," Mrs. Medlock said. "She's become pretty and lost her sour look. She laughs with Colin like crazy. Maybe they're growing fat on that."

"Perhaps," Dr. Craven said. "Let them laugh."
