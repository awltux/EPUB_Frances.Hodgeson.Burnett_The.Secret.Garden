## CHAPTER 7
### The Key of the Garden
Mary woke to a sky bursting with blue, a colour she'd never seen in India's blazing heat. "Look at the moor!" she called to Martha.

Martha grinned. "Aye, the storm's gone for now. Spring's comin', but it's a long way off yet."

"I thought it always rained here," Mary admitted.

"Eh! No!" Martha laughed, describing the moor in springtime as a place of gold and purple, butterflies and bees.

Mary gazed longingly at the distant blue. "Could I ever get there?"

"You've never used your legs," Martha said. "Our cottage is five miles away." But she promised to ask her mother, someone who "nearly always sees a way to do things."

After Martha left, Mary felt lonelier than ever. She ran laps around the garden to lift her mood. Ben Weatherstaff, working nearby, seemed cheered by the weather.

"Springtime's coming," he said. "Can't you smell it?"

Mary sniffed. "I smell something nice and fresh."

"That's the good rich earth," Ben said, explaining how the plants were stirring beneath the soil. "You watch them."

Then, she saw the robin again, hopping closer than before. "Do you think he remembers me?" she asked Ben.

"Remembers you! He knows everything. Heâ€™s finding out about you."

Mary, wanting to know about the secret garden, asked, "Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden?"

"Ask him," Ben grunted, gesturing to the robin. "No one else has seen inside it for ten year'."

Mary wandered along the ivy-covered wall. Suddenly, the robin appeared, chirping and flirting its tail. She felt a thrill of happiness; it was as if he were a real person.

The robin hopped over a patch of freshly turned earth. Mary noticed something half-buried: a rusty ring of iron or brass. As the robin flew to a tree, she picked it up. It was an old key.

"Perhaps it has been buried for ten years," she whispered, her face pale. "Perhaps it is the key to the garden!"
