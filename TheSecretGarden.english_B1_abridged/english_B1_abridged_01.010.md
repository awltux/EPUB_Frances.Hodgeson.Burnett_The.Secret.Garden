## CHAPTER 10
### Dickon
The sun beat down on 'the secret garden' for a week. Mary loved the name, loved the feeling of being locked away from the world within its walls. She felt like she was in a fairy tale. Unlike those who slept for a hundred years in the stories, Mary was waking up, becoming more alive with each day at Misselthwaite. She liked being outside now, enjoyed the wind, and could run faster.

In the secret garden, the bulbs beneath the soil seemed to respond to her care. She made space for them, and they began to thrive, feeling the warmth of the sun and the touch of the rain.

Mary became absorbed in her project, digging and weeding with a determination that surprised her. It felt like a game, finding new shoots pushing through the earth. There were so many, like Martha had said, "snowdrops by the thousands," left alone for ten years, spreading and waiting. Mary wondered when they would bloom.

She found herself spending time with Ben Weatherstaff. She would appear beside him silently, afraid he would leave if he saw her coming. But he didn't seem to mind her company as much anymore. Maybe he was flattered by her attention, or maybe it was that she was learning to be more polite.

"You're like the robin," he said one morning. "I never know when I'll see you or where you'll come from."

"He’s friends with me now," said Mary.

Ben grumbled, calling the robin vain, but then he looked at Mary. "How long have you been here?" he asked.

"About a month, I think," she replied.

"You're starting to do Misselthwaite credit," he said. "You're a bit fatter and not so yellow. You looked like a plucked crow when you first came."

Mary didn't care much about her looks, but she knew she was getting bigger. "My stockings are getting tighter, they used to make wrinkles." she said. "There's the robin, Ben Weatherstaff."

The robin hopped about, showing off for Ben, who remained sarcastic. The bird flew onto Ben's spade, and the old man's face softened. He whispered, "Well, I’m danged! You know how to get at a chap, you do!"

He stood still until the robin flew away, then looked at the spade handle as if it were magic. He started digging again, grinning.

"Do you have a garden of your own?" Mary asked.

"No," he answered. "I live with Martin at the gate."

"If you had one, what would you plant?"

"Cabbages, potatoes, onions."

"But if you wanted a flower garden?"

"Bulbs and sweet-smelling things, but mostly roses."

Mary’s face lit up. "Do you like roses?"

Ben admitted he did, remembering a young lady he used to work for who loved them like children. "That was ten years ago."

"Where is she now?" Mary asked.

"Heaven," he answered.

"What happened to the roses?"

"They were left to themselves."

"Did they die?"

"I liked them, and I liked her, so once or twice a year I'd go and work at them a bit. They ran wild, but they lived."

"How can you tell if they are dead or alive?"

"Wait till spring, till the sun shines on the rain. Look for a bit of a brown lump swelling on the twigs." He stopped, looking at her curiously. "Why do you care so much about roses all of a sudden?"

Mary felt her face turn red. "I want to pretend that I have a garden of my own. There's nothing for me to do. I have nothing and no one."

"Well, that's true," Ben said, his voice softer than usual.

Mary had never felt sorry for herself before, but now the world seemed to be changing. If no one found out about the secret garden, she could finally be happy.

She asked Ben more questions, and he answered them in his usual grumpy way. As she left, she asked, "Do you go and see those other roses now?"

"Not this year. My rheumatics make me too stiff."

Then he got angry suddenly. "Don't ask so many questions! Go away and play. I've done talking for today."

Mary skipped away, deciding that she liked old Ben Weatherstaff, even if he was cross.

She walked along a laurel path, past the secret garden, and opened a gate into the woods. She heard a whistling sound and stopped.

A boy sat under a tree, playing a wooden pipe. He had red cheeks and bright blue eyes. A squirrel clung to the tree, and a pheasant and two rabbits watched him.

When he saw Mary, he held up his hand. "Don't move," he said. "It'd frighten them."

Mary stood still. He stopped playing and stood up slowly. The animals moved away, but not as if they were scared.

"I'm Dickon," the boy said. "I know you're Miss Mary."

Mary realised she had known it too. Only Dickon could charm animals like that.

"I got up slow," he explained, "because you have to move gentle when wild things are about."

He spoke as if they were old friends.

"Did you get Martha's letter?" she asked.

He nodded. "That's why I came."

He picked up some garden tools and showed her packets of seeds. "There's mignonette and poppies. Mignonette's the sweetest smelling thing, and it'll grow anywhere, same as poppies."

He stopped and turned his head. "Where's that robin calling us?"

The chirp came from a holly bush.

"Is it really calling us?" Mary asked.

"Aye," Dickon said. "He's calling someone he's friends with. He'll tell me all about you in a minute."

He moved closer to the bush and made a sound like the robin's twitter. The robin answered.

"Aye, he's a friend of yours," Dickon chuckled.

"Do you think he really likes me?" Mary asked.

"He wouldn't come near you if he didn't. Birds are rare choosers."

The robin hopped about, looking at her.

"Do you understand everything birds say?" Mary asked.

Dickon grinned. "I think I do, and they think I do. I've lived on the moor with them so long. Sometimes I think I'm one of them."

He began to talk about the flower seeds again, telling her how to plant them.

"I'll plant them for you." he said. "Where is your garden?"

Mary didn't know what to say. She hadn't thought of this.

"You've got a bit of garden, haven't you?" Dickon asked.

She held her hands tight and looked at him. "I don't know anything about boys. Could you keep a secret, if I told you one? It's a great secret. I should die if anyone found it out!"

Dickon looked puzzled. "I'm keeping secrets all the time. Aye, I can keep secrets."

Mary grabbed his sleeve. "I've stolen a garden. It isn't mine. It isn't anybody's. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it. Perhaps everything is dead in it already; I don't know. I don't care!" she burst out. "Nobody has any right to take it from me when I care about it and they don't. They're letting it die!" She threw her arms over her face and cried.

Dickon’s eyes grew round. “Eh-h-h!” he said softly, full of wonder and sympathy.

"I've nothing to do," Mary said. "Nothing belongs to me. I found it myself. I was just like the robin, and they wouldn’t take it from the robin."

"Where is it?" Dickon asked.

Mary stood up. "Come with me and I'll show you."

She led him to the ivy-covered wall. Dickon followed, looking at her with pity. When she lifted the ivy, he started. There was a door. She pushed it open, and they stepped inside.

"It’s this," she said. "It’s a secret garden, and I’m the only one in the world who wants it to be alive."

Dickon looked around in wonder. "Eh!" he whispered. "It is a queer, pretty place! It’s like as if a body was in a dream."
