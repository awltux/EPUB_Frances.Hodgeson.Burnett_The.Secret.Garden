## CHAPTER 26
### It’s Mother!
The Magic felt real. Colin enjoyed giving lectures about it, pretending he was a scientist.

"It's good practice," he said, "for when I make discoveries."

Ben Weatherstaff watched Colin with proud eyes. He noticed Colin’s legs were stronger, his face fuller.

"What are you thinking about, Ben?" Colin asked.

"I reckon you've gained weight this week," Ben replied.

"It's the Magic, and Mrs. Sowerby's baking!" Colin declared.

Dickon arrived, his face glowing from running. They weeded together, Colin lecturing as he worked.

"The Magic works best when you work, too," he said.

Suddenly, Colin stood straight, dropping his trowel. He stretched, joy lighting his face.

"Mary! Dickon! Look at me!" he cried. "I'm well!"

Dickon smiled, seeing the change in Colin.

"I’m going to live forever!" Colin exclaimed. "I want to shout something joyful!"

"Sing the Doxology," Ben grumbled.

"What's that?" Colin asked.

Dickon smiled. "Mother says skylarks sing it in the morning."

"Sing it, Dickon," Colin urged. "I want to hear it."

Dickon removed his cap. "You must take yours off too, Colin, Ben."

Dickon sang, his voice clear and strong:

> Praise God from whom all blessings flow, 
> Praise Him all creatures here below, 
> Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host, 
> Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 

When he finished, Ben’s face was emotional. Colin was thoughtful. "It’s a nice song. It’s like being thankful for the Magic."

They sang it again, and Ben joined in, his voice rough but heartfelt.

"Who's coming?" Colin asked, startled by the opening of the garden door. A woman entered. She wore a blue cloak, sunlight dappling it, and she smiled warmly.

"It's Mother!" Dickon cried, running to her.

Colin and Mary followed.

"Even when I was ill, I wanted to see you," Colin said shyly.

Her expression softened. "Eh! dear lad!" she said. "You’re like your mother."

"Will my Father like me now?" Colin asked.

"For sure, dear lad," she replied. "He must come home."

Ben examined Colin’s legs. "They’re strong now!"

"Let him play and eat well," Susan Sowerby said. "He’ll be fine." She looked at Mary. "You’re like your mother, too. A blush rose."

They showed Susan their garden, telling its story. She listened, her presence comforting.

"Do you believe in Magic?" Colin asked.

"I do, lad," she said. "It's the Good Thing. The same thing that makes seeds grow made you well. Keep believing."

"I felt so joyful," Colin said. "I wanted to shout."

"The Magic listened," she replied. "It was the joy that mattered."

Susan shared a feast she had brought, laughing with them. They talked about her cottage, planning a visit.

As she left, Colin held her cloak. "I wish you were my mother, as well as Dickon’s!"

Susan hugged him close. "Eh! dear lad! Your own mother’s in this garden, I believe. Your father must come back."
