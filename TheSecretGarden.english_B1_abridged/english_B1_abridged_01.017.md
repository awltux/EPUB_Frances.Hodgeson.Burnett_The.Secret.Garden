## CHAPTER 17
### A Tantrum
Mary was tired and sleepy after working in the garden all day. She was just drifting off when horrible screams jolted her awake. It was Colin, throwing one of his tantrums.

"Sounds awful," she thought, remembering the nurse calling them hysterics. "No wonder everyone gives him what he wants."

The screams made her feel sick. "I can't bear it," she repeated, hands clamped over her ears. She was so angry and terrified she wanted to scream back, remembering he'd kicked her out this morning.

Just then, the nurse burst in, looking pale. "He's in hysterics! No one can handle him. Please, Mary, he likes you."

Mary stamped her foot, "He threw me out!"

"Exactly the right mood," the nurse said, relieved Mary wasn't cowering under the covers. "Go on, give him what-for. Shock him. Quick as you can!"

Later, Mary realised how funny it was: all the grown-ups scared and turning to her because she was almost as bad as Colin.

Furious, she stormed into Colin's room. "STOP IT!" she yelled. "I hate you! Everyone hates you! I wish you'd scream yourself to death!"

A kind child wouldn't say such things, but it was exactly what Colin needed. He'd been lying face down, hitting his pillow, and he almost jumped at her furious voice.

"If you scream again," Mary threatened, "I'll scream louder and frighten you!"

He stopped, shocked. Tears streamed down his face as he gasped, "I can't stop!"

"You can!" Mary shouted. "It's just hysterics!"

"I felt the lump," Colin choked. "I'll have a hunchback and die!"

"You didn't feel a lump!" Mary snapped. "It's a hysterical lump! Let me see!"

The nurse, Mrs. Medlock, and Martha were huddled by the door, mouths open. The nurse hesitantly came forward. Colin gasped, "Show her! She'll see!"

His back was thin, ribs showing. Mary examined it, her face serious. After a moment, she declared, "There isn't a lump! Just backbone lumps, and you're thin, so you feel them. I have them too! If you say there's a lump again, I'll laugh!"

Her harsh words had a huge effect. Colin had spent years dwelling on his illness, but now this angry girl was saying he wasn't as ill as he thought. Maybe she was right?

"I didn't know he thought he had a lump," the nurse said. "His back's weak because he won't sit up. I could have told him."

"Could you?" Colin said quietly.

"Yes, sir."

"There!" said Mary.

Colin turned his face into the pillow, tears soaking it. A strange relief washed over him. He looked at the nurse and asked, "Do you think... I could live to grow up?"

"You probably will," she said, repeating the doctor's words, "if you do as you're told, don't throw tantrums, and get fresh air."

Colin, exhausted from crying, gently reached for Mary's hand. Her own anger gone, she took it.

"I'll go out with you, Mary," he said. "I won't hate fresh air if we can find..." He stopped himself from saying 'the secret garden' and finished, "...if Dickon pushes my chair. I want to see Dickon, the fox, and the crow."

The nurse tidied the bed and gave them beef tea. Mrs. Medlock and Martha slipped away.

"You must sleep," the nurse said, yawning. "I'll lie down next door."

"I'll sing him my Ayah's song," Mary whispered.

"Oh, yes!" Colin said. "It's so soft."

"He'll be asleep in no time," Mary told the nurse.

As soon as the nurse left, Colin whispered, "I almost told! Tell me what you think the secret garden looks like. It'll make me sleep."

Mary looked at his tired face and said, "Okay. Close your eyes."

He closed his eyes, and she began softly, "It's been left alone so long, it's grown into a lovely tangle. Roses climb everywhere, like a strange grey mist. Some are dead, but many are alive. In summer, there will be curtains and fountains of roses. The ground is full of daffodils, snowdrops, lilies, and iris pushing through the dark. Now that spring is here, maybe... maybe..."

Her voice was soothing him. "Perhaps they're coming up through the grass. Maybe there are purple and gold crocuses even now. Maybe the leaves are starting to uncurl. Perhaps the grey is changing, and a green veil is creeping over everything. Birds are coming to look, because it's so safe and still. And perhaps... perhaps... the robin has found a mate and is building a nest."

And Colin was asleep.
