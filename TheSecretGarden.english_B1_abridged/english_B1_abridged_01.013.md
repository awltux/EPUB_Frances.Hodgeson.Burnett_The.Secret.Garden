## CHAPTER 13
### I Am Colin
Mary showed Martha the picture.

“Eh!” Martha said proudly. “Our Dickon’s clever, that he is. It’s a missel thrush on its nest, as natural as can be.”

Mary realised the picture was a message from Dickon. He would keep her secret. Her garden was her nest, and she was the missel thrush. She liked that strange boy.

She hoped he’d return the next day, but Yorkshire weather is unpredictable. Rain lashed against the windows all night.

"The rain is as contrary as I am," she muttered, hating the mournful sound. "It's come because I don't want it to."

She couldn't sleep. The wind howled like someone lost on the moor, crying.

After an hour, she heard something else. Not the wind. Faint, fretful crying.

"It's that crying I heard before," she whispered.

The sound came from down the corridor with the tapestry door. Rebellious, she grabbed her candle.

"I'm going to find out what it is!"

The corridor was dark, but she was too curious to care. She followed the crying, her heart pounding. There, behind the tapestry, was a door with light beneath it. The crying was coming from that room.

She pushed the door open.

It was a large, old-fashioned room. A boy lay in a four-poster bed, crying.

He was pale, with big, grey eyes and hair falling over his forehead. He looked tired and cross.

Mary stood frozen. Was she dreaming?

The boy saw her. “Who are you?” he whispered, scared. “Are you a ghost?”

“No,” Mary whispered back. “Are you?”

He stared. “No. I am Colin.”

“Who is Colin?”

“I am Colin Craven. Who are you?”

“I am Mary Lennox. Mr Craven is my uncle.”

“He is my Father,” the boy said.

“Your Father!” Mary gasped. “No one told me he had a boy! Why?”

“Come here,” he said, his eyes fixed on her.

She came closer. He touched her hand.

“You are real, aren’t you? I have such real dreams.”

Mary pulled at her woollen wrapper. “Rub that. I'll pinch you, if you like, to prove I'm real.”

“Where did you come from?” he asked.

“My room. The wind kept me awake, and I heard crying. Why were you crying?”

“I couldn’t sleep. My head aches. What’s your name again?”

“Mary Lennox. Did no one tell you I live here?”

He still held her wrapper. “No,” he said. “They daren’t.”

“Why?” Mary asked.

“Because I don’t let people see me. I don’t want them talking about me.”

“Why?”

“Because I’m always ill. If I live, I might be a hunchback. But I won’t live. My Father hates to think I’ll be like him.”

“What a queer house this is!” Mary said. “Everything’s a secret. Locked rooms, locked gardens, and you! Have you been locked up?”

“No. I stay here. It’s too tiring to move.”

“Does your Father visit?” Mary asked.

“Sometimes. When I’m asleep. He doesn’t want to see me.”

“Why?”

A shadow crossed his face. “My Mother died when I was born. It makes him sad to see me. He almost hates me.”

“He hates the garden, because she died,” Mary said quietly.

“What garden?” he asked.

“Just—just a garden she liked,” Mary stammered. “Have you always been here?”

“Nearly always. The doctor said I needed fresh air, but I hate fresh air. I don’t want to go out.”

“I didn’t, when I first came,” said Mary. “Why do you keep looking at me like that?”

“Because of the real dreams,” he said.

“We’re both awake,” said Mary, glancing around the room. “It feels like a dream. It's the middle of the night, and everyone's asleep but us.”

“I don’t want it to be a dream,” he said.

Mary had an idea. "If you don't like people seeing you, do you want me to go?"

He pulled her wrapper. “No. I’d think you were a dream. Sit down and talk. Tell me about you.”

Mary sat on a stool. She wanted to stay and talk to the mysterious boy.

“What do you want me to tell you?” she asked.

He asked about Misselthwaite, her room, what she did, if she disliked the moor. She told him about India and her voyage. Because he was ill, he hadn't learned like other children. He loved reading and pictures.

He had everything he wanted but was never amused.

“Everyone does what I want,” he said. “It makes me ill to be angry. No one thinks I’ll live.” He seemed used to the idea. “How old are you?” he asked.

“I’m ten,” Mary said, forgetting herself, “and so are you.”

“How do you know?” he asked, surprised.

“When you were born, the garden door was locked, and the key buried. It’s been locked for ten years.”

Colin sat up. “What garden door? Who locked it? Where’s the key?”

“It was the garden Mr Craven hates,” Mary said nervously. “He locked it. No one knows where he buried the key.”

“What sort of garden is it?” Colin asked eagerly.

“No one’s been in it for ten years,” Mary said carefully.

He was like her, with nothing to think about. The hidden garden intrigued him.

“They won’t talk about it,” said Mary. “They’ve been told not to answer questions.”

“I would make them,” said Colin.

“Could you?” Mary asked, frightened.

“Everyone pleases me. This place will be mine. I’d make them tell me.”

Mary saw how spoiled he was. He thought the world belonged to him.

“Do you think you won’t live?” she asked.

“I don’t suppose I shall,” he said. “Ever since I can remember, people have said I won’t. My doctor is Father’s cousin. He’ll inherit Misselthwaite if I die. I expect he wants me to die.”

“Do you want to live?” Mary asked.

“No,” he said, “but I don’t want to die. When I feel ill, I cry and cry.”

“I’ve heard you crying,” Mary said. “Were you crying about that?” She wanted him to forget the garden.

“Maybe,” he said. “Let’s talk about the garden. Don’t you want to see it?”

“Yes,” Mary said softly.

“I do,” he said. “I’ve never wanted to see anything before, but I want to see that garden. I want the key dug up. I want the door unlocked. I’d let them take me there in my chair. That would be fresh air. I’m going to make them open the door.”

His eyes shone. “They have to please me,” he said. “I’ll make them take me, and you can come, too.”

Mary’s hands clenched. Everything would be ruined! Dickon wouldn’t come back.

“Oh, don’t—don’t—don’t!” she cried.

He stared, as if she was mad. “Why? You said you wanted to see it.”

“I do,” she sobbed, “but if you make them open it, it won’t be a secret anymore.”

He leaned forward. “A secret? What do you mean? Tell me.”

“A secret between you and me. There was a door under the ivy—if we found it, and slipped through and locked it behind us, if no one knew we were inside, if we called it our garden and pretended we were missel thrushes in our nest, and played there every day and planted bulbs and made it alive—”

“Is it dead?” he asked.

“It will be if no one cares for it,” she continued.

“What are bulbs?” he asked quickly.

“Daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They’re working in the earth now.”

“Is spring coming?” he said. “What’s it like? You don’t see it in rooms.”

“It’s the sun on the rain, and the rain on the sunshine, and things pushing up under the earth,” said Mary. “If the garden was a secret, we could watch things grow. Don’t you see how much nicer it would be as a secret?”

He lay back, with an odd look.

“I’ve never had a secret,” he said, “except about not living. But I like this better.”

“If you don’t make them take you to the garden,” Mary begged, “maybe I can find a way in. And if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, we could find some boy to push you, and we could go alone, and it would always be a secret garden.”

“I’d like that,” he said slowly. “I wouldn’t mind fresh air in a secret garden.”

Mary felt safer.

“I’ll tell you what it would be like,” she said. “It’s been shut up so long, things might be tangled.”

He listened as she described the roses, the birds, the robin and Ben Weatherstaff. The robin pleased him. He smiled.

“I didn’t know birds were like that,” he said. “If you stay in a room, you never see things. You know so much. I feel like you’ve been inside that garden.”

Mary stayed silent.

“I’m going to let you look at something,” he said. “See that rose-coloured silk curtain on the wall?”

“Yes,” she answered, looking toward the wall.

“There’s a cord. Pull it.”

Mary pulled the cord. The curtain revealed a picture of a smiling girl. Her eyes were like Colin’s, grey with dark lashes.

“She’s my Mother,” said Colin sadly. “I don’t see why she died. Sometimes I hate her for it.”

“How strange!” said Mary.

“If she’d lived, I wouldn’t be ill. And Father wouldn’t hate to look at me. I’d have a strong back. Draw the curtain again.”

Mary did and returned to her stool.

“She’s prettier than you,” she said, “but her eyes are like yours. Why is the curtain drawn?”

He shifted. “I made them do it. Sometimes I don’t like her looking at me. She smiles too much when I’m miserable. Besides, she’s mine. I don’t want everyone to see her.”

After a moment, Mary spoke.

“What would Mrs Medlock do if she knew I was here?”

“She’d do as I told her. I’d say I wanted you to come here every day. I’m glad you came.”

“So am I,” said Mary. “I’ll come often, but I need to look for the garden door.”

“Yes, you must,” said Colin.

He thought. “I think you’ll be a secret, too. I won’t tell them until they find out. I can send the nurse away. Do you know Martha?”

“Yes, I know her well. She waits on me.”

He nodded. “She’s asleep in the other room. The nurse is with her sister and Martha looks after me. Martha will tell you when to come here.”

Mary now understood Martha’s evasiveness about the crying.

“Martha knew about you all along?” she said.

“Yes; she often looks after me. The nurse likes to get away, and Martha comes.”

“I’ve been here a long time,” said Mary. “Shall I go? You look sleepy.”

“I wish I could sleep before you leave,” he said shyly.

“Shut your eyes,” said Mary, pulling her stool closer, “and I’ll do what my Ayah did in India. I’ll pat your hand and sing.”

“I’d like that,” he said drowsily.

She felt sorry for him. She patted his hand and sang a low song in Hindustani.

“That’s nice,” he said, even more drowsily. She went on singing, but when she looked again, his eyes were closed. He was asleep. She took her candle and crept away quietly.
