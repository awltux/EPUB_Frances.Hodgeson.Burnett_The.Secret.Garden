## CHAPTER 20
### And I shall live forever and ever!
Colin was getting impatient. The wind kept howling, and then he felt a cold coming on. He would have thrown a tantrum, but he and Mary were busy planning something exciting with Dickon. Dickon visited often, sharing stories of the moor – otters, badgers, birds building homes.

"They're like us," Dickon said, "but they have to build everything from scratch every year!"

The big challenge was how to get Colin to the secret garden without anyone seeing. It was all about mystery, and they didn't want to spoil it. People must think he was just out for a walk with his friends. They carefully planned their route, path by path, like generals planning a battle.

Rumours spread among the servants about strange things happening in Colin's room. One day, Mr. Roach, the head gardener, was told to go to Colin. He had never seen Colin and had heard many stories about his strange looks and terrible temper.

"Things are changing," Mrs. Medlock said, leading him to Colin's room.

"Let's hope it's for the better," Mr. Roach replied.

"It couldn't get worse," she said. "Don't be surprised if you find animals everywhere, with Dickon Sowerby more at home than us."

Mr. Roach smiled when he heard Dickon's name. "He'd be at home anywhere, that lad."

When the door opened, a crow greeted him loudly. Mr. Roach almost jumped back. Colin wasn't in bed. He was in a chair, a lamb beside him, and Dickon was feeding it milk. A squirrel sat on Dickon's back, nibbling a nut. Mary was sitting on the floor, watching.

"This is Mr. Roach, Master Colin," Mrs. Medlock announced.

Colin looked him up and down. "Oh, you're Roach? I have important orders for you."

"Very good, sir," Mr. Roach said, wondering what was coming.

"I'm going out in my chair this afternoon," Colin said. "If the fresh air suits me, I might go every day. When I do, no gardeners should be near the Long Walk by the garden walls. Everyone must keep away until I say so."

"Very good, sir," Mr. Roach answered, a wave of relief washing over him that the manor grounds were safe from reckless impulses.

"Mary," Colin asked, "what do you say in India when you want people to leave?"

"You say, 'You have my permission to go,'" Mary replied.

Colin waved his hand. "You have my permission to go, Roach. But remember, this is very important."

"Caw—Caw!" the crow added.

"Very good, sir. Thank you, sir," Mr. Roach said, and Mrs. Medlock led him out.

Outside, he smiled. "He's got a lordly way about him! Like a Royal Family all in one!"

"He's always been waited on," Mrs. Medlock said.

"Maybe he'll grow out of it," Mr. Roach suggested.

"Well," Mrs. Medlock said, "if he lives and Mary stays here, she'll teach him the world doesn't revolve around him."

Inside, Colin leaned back. "It's all safe now! This afternoon, I'll see it!"

Dickon went back to the garden with his animals, and Mary stayed with Colin. He was quiet before lunch, thinking.

"What big eyes you've got, Colin," Mary said. "What are you thinking about?"

"I can't stop thinking about what it will look like," he answered.

"The garden?" Mary asked.

"The springtime," he said. "I've never really seen it before. I never went out or looked at it."

"I never saw it in India," Mary said.

Colin, despite his isolated life, had a good imagination and spent time with books.

"When you said, 'It's come!' you made me feel strange. It felt like things were coming with music. I have a picture like it—people with flowers, laughing. That's why I said, 'Perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets.'"

"How funny!" Mary said. "That's what it feels like! Flowers and birds dancing and singing!"

They laughed because they loved the idea. Later, the nurse dressed Colin. He sat up and helped, talking and laughing with Mary.

"He's in good spirits," she told Dr. Craven. "It makes him stronger."

"I'll call again later," Dr. Craven said. "I wish he would let you go with him."

"I'd rather leave than suggest that," the nurse said firmly.

"We'll try it. I trust Dickon," the doctor replied.

The footman carried Colin downstairs to his chair, where Dickon waited. Colin waved goodbye to the servants.

"You have my permission to go," he said, and they disappeared, giggling.

Dickon pushed the chair slowly. Mary walked beside it, and Colin looked up at the sky. The wind smelled of the moor. Colin breathed it in, and his eyes widened as if listening.

"There are so many sounds," he said. "What's that scent?"

"It's gorse on the moor," Dickon answered. "The bees are busy today."

No one was around. Gardeners had been sent away. They followed their planned route, enjoying the mystery. Finally, they reached the Long Walk by the walls, and they whispered, excited.

"This is it," Mary breathed. "Where I walked and wondered."

"Is it?" Colin cried, searching the ivy. "I see nothing. No door."

"That's what I thought," Mary said.

They moved on in silence.

"That's where Ben Weatherstaff works," Mary said.

"Is it?" Colin asked.

"This is where the robin flew over the wall," Mary whispered.

"It is? Oh, I wish he'd come again!" Colin cried.

"And that," Mary said, pointing to a lilac bush, "is where he showed me the key."

Colin sat up. "Where? There?"

Dickon stopped the chair.

"And this," Mary said, stepping close to the ivy, "is where I talked to him when the wind blew the ivy back."

"Oh! is it?" Colin gasped.

"And here's the handle, and here's the door. Dickon, push him in!"

Dickon pushed him in.

Colin fell back, covering his eyes. When the chair stopped, he looked around. Green leaves covered everything, and there were touches of gold, purple, and white. The trees were pink and white, and there were birds, scents, and sunshine. Mary and Dickon stared at him. He looked different, with colour in his face.

"I shall get well! I shall get well!" he cried. "Mary! Dickon! I shall get well! And I shall live forever and ever!"
