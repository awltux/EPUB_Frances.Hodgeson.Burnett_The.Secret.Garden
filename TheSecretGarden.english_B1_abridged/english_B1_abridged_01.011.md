## CHAPTER 11
### The Nest of the Missel Thrush
Dickon quietly looked around the secret garden. “Never thought I’d see this,” he whispered.

“You knew?” Mary asked, forgetting to keep her voice down.

Dickon held up a hand. “Quiet, or someone will wonder what we’re doing in here.”

Mary, startled, clapped a hand over her mouth. “Did you know about the garden?” she asked again, quieter this time.

Dickon nodded. “Martha told me there was one no one ever went into. We wondered what it was like.” He gazed around at the tangled plants, a happy look in his eyes. “Eh, the nests there will be come springtime! Safest place in England. I wonder the moor birds don’t all build here.”

Without thinking, Mary touched his arm. “Will there be roses? Are they all dead?”

“No, not all,” Dickon said, heading to an old tree covered in grey growth. He pulled out a knife. “Lots of dead wood to cut out. But some new growth too. See this?” He touched a shoot that was brownish-green.

Mary touched it carefully. “That one? Is it alive?”

Dickon smiled. “It’s as wick as you or me.”

“I’m glad it’s wick!” Mary whispered. “I want them all to be wick. Let’s count the wick ones.”

They moved from tree to tree. Dickon used his knife, showing Mary things she’d never noticed. “They’ve run wild, but the strongest have thrived. The weak ones died. See!” He pulled down a thick, grey branch. “Looks dead, but I don’t think it is. I’ll cut it and see.”

He knelt and cut the branch close to the earth. “There!” he said happily. “Green in that wood yet. Look.”

Mary knelt beside him.

“When it’s greenish and juicy, it’s wick,” he explained. “If it’s dry and breaks easy, it’s done for. There’s a big root here, and if we cut off the old wood and take care of it, there’ll be a fountain of roses this summer.”

They worked together. Dickon was strong and knew what to cut. Mary started to see the signs of life too, and she’d quietly shout when she saw green. The spade and fork were useful. He showed her how to use them, digging and letting air into the soil.

Working near a big rose, Dickon suddenly stopped. “Who did that?”

He pointed to Mary’s clearings around the green shoots.

“I did,” Mary said.

“I thought you knew nothing about gardening,” he said.

“I don’t, but they were so small, and the grass was so thick. I made a space for them. I don’t even know what they are.”

Dickon knelt, smiling. “You were right. They’ll grow now. They’re crocuses and snowdrops, and these are narcissuses, and daffydowndillys. Eh, they will be a sight!”

He looked back at Mary. “You’ve done a lot of work for such a little thing.”

“I’m getting fatter and stronger,” Mary said. “I used to be tired all the time. When I dig, I’m not tired at all. I like the smell of the earth.”

“It’s good for you,” Dickon said. “There’s nothing as nice as the smell of clean earth, except the smell of fresh growing things when it rains. I lie under a bush on the moor when it’s raining and just sniff. Mother says my nose quivers like a rabbit’s.”

“Do you never catch cold?” Mary asked, surprised.

“Not me,” he grinned. “Never have. I wasn’t brought up soft. I’ve been out on the moor in all weathers. I’m as tough as anything.”

He kept working as he talked, and Mary helped.

“There’s a lot to do here,” he said happily.

“Will you come again and help me?” Mary asked. “I can help too. I can dig and pull weeds. Oh, do come, Dickon!”

“I’ll come every day if you want me, rain or shine,” he said. “It’s the best fun I’ve ever had, shut in here and waking up a garden.”

“If you come and help me make it alive, I’ll—I don’t know what I’ll do,” she said.

“I’ll tell you what you’ll do,” Dickon said, smiling. “You’ll get fat, and as hungry as a young fox, and you’ll learn to talk to the robin like I do. Eh, we’ll have a lot of fun.”

He looked around thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t want it to look like a proper garden, all neat and tidy, would you? It’s nicer like this, wild.”

“Don’t let’s make it tidy,” Mary said. “It wouldn’t be a secret garden if it was tidy.”

Dickon rubbed his head, puzzled. “It’s a secret garden, sure enough. But someone besides the robin must have been in it since it was shut up.”

“But the door was locked, and the key was buried,” Mary said. “No one could get in.”

“That’s true,” he said. “It’s a queer place. Seems like there’s been some pruning done here and there, later than ten years ago.”

“But how?” Mary asked.

He shook his head. “Aye, how? With the door locked and the key buried.”

Mary knew she would never forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. When Dickon started to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered the song that Basil used to sing.

“Are there any flowers that look like bells?” she asked.

“Lilies of the valley do,” he said, digging. “And Canterbury bells, and campanulas.”

“Let’s plant some,” Mary said.

“There’s lilies of the valley here already. They’ll have grown too close, but there’s plenty. The others take two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you some plants from our cottage garden. Why do you want them?”

Mary told him about Basil and his family in India, and how she had hated them calling her “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary.”

“They used to dance and sing:

> Mistress Mary, quite contrary,
> How does your garden grow?
> With silver bells, and cockle shells,
> And marigolds all in a row.

“I remembered it and wondered if there were really flowers like silver bells.”

She frowned and dug her trowel into the earth. “I wasn’t as contrary as they were.”

Dickon laughed. “Eh,” he said, sniffing the soil, “there doesn’t seem to be any need to be contrary when there’s flowers and suchlike, and friendly wild things running about, building nests and singing, does there?”

Mary looked at him. “Dickon, you are as nice as Martha said. I like you, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like five people.”

Dickon sat back, surprised. “Only five folk you like? Who are the other four?”

“Your mother and Martha,” Mary counted them off, “and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.”

Dickon laughed, covering his mouth to be quiet.

“I know you think I’m a queer lad,” he said, “but I think you are the queerest little thing I ever saw.”

Then Mary did something strange. She leaned forward and asked a question she’d never asked anyone before. “Do you like me?” she said.

“Eh,” he said, “that I do. I like you wonderful, and so does the robin, I believe!”

“That’s two, then,” Mary said. “That’s two for me.”

They worked harder than ever. Mary was sad when she heard the clock strike midday.

“I have to go,” she said. “And you will too, won’t you?”

Dickon grinned. “My dinner’s easy to carry.” He took a bundle from his pocket, tied in a blue and white handkerchief. It held two pieces of bread with bacon between them.

“It’s often just bread,” he said, “but I’ve got bacon today.”

Mary thought it looked a funny dinner, but he looked happy to eat it.

“Go get your food,” he said. “I’ll be done with mine first. I’ll get more work done before I go home.”

He sat down against a tree. “I’ll call the robin and give him the bacon rind. They love a bit of fat.”

Mary didn’t want to leave him. He seemed like a wood fairy who might be gone when she came back. He seemed too good to be true. She went halfway to the door, then stopped and came back.

“Whatever happens, you—you never would tell?” she said.

His cheeks were full of bread and bacon, but he smiled. “If you were a missel thrush and showed me your nest, would you think I’d tell anyone? Not me,” he said. “You are as safe as a missel thrush.”

And she knew she was.
