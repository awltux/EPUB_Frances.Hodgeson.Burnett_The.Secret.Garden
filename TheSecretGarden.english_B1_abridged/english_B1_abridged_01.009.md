## CHAPTER 9
### The Strangest House Anyone Ever Lived In
It was the most magical place, Mary thought, hidden by high walls covered in climbing roses. She knew them from India. The ground was brown with winter, but rose bushes grew everywhere, some like small trees. Roses had climbed all over the other trees, creating swaying curtains and bridges of grey branches. It felt ancient and secret, unlike any garden she’d seen before.

“How quiet it is,” she whispered, the only sound her own voice. Even the robin, perched high in a tree, was still. “I’m the first person to speak here in ten years.”

She moved carefully, stepping softly on the grass, walking beneath the arches of roses. « I wonder if they’re dead?" she questioned. « Is it all dead? I wish it wasn’t. »

She couldn't tell if the wood was alive, but she was inside, able to return through the ivy-covered door whenever she wished. It felt like her own private world. The sun shone within the walls, and the robin chirped, hopping from bush to bush, as if showing her around. It was strange and silent, but Mary didn't feel alone. She just wished she knew if the roses might bloom again when it got warmer.

Skipping-rope over her arm, she walked, then thought she would skip round the garden, stopping to look at things. There were paths and little alcoves with stone seats. Near one, she spotted tiny green shoots pushing through the earth. Remembering what Ben Weatherstaff had said, she knelt.

“Crocuses, snowdrops, or daffodils,” she whispered, smelling the damp earth. « Maybe there are more. »

She searched the garden, finding more green shoots and felt excited. « It isn’t dead," she whispered. « Even if the roses are, other things are alive. »

She didn’t know about gardening, but the grass looked too thick for the shoots to grow. Finding a sharp piece of wood, she dug around them, clearing the weeds and grass.

« Now they can breathe," she said, pleased with herself.

She dug and weeded, enjoying herself so much she forgot the time. The exercise warmed her, and she took off her coat and hat, smiling at the green shoots.

The robin was happy to see her gardening. It was always a chance of worms! Mary worked until lunchtime, not realising how long she’d been there. She was happy, her cheeks were red and she ate so much dinner that Martha was delighted.

“Two pieces of meat and two helpings of rice pudding!” she exclaimed.

While digging, Mary had found some plants that she didnt recognise. « Martha," she asked, « what are those white roots like onions?"

« Bulbs," Martha replied. « Spring flowers grow from them. Snowdrops, crocuses, daffodils. Dickon knows all about them. »

« Do bulbs live a long time?" Mary asked anxiously. « Even if no one helps them?"

« They help themselves," said Martha. « If you leave them alone, they’ll grow for years. There's snowdrops by the thousands in the park woods. No one knows when they were first planted. »

« I wish it was spring," said Mary. « I want to see everything grow. »

She finished dinner and sat by the fire. « I wish I had a little spade. »

« What do you want a spade for?" Martha asked, laughing.

Mary hesitated. She had to be careful about her secret garden. « It's such a big, lonely place," she said. « The house, the park, the gardens – all lonely. I thought if I had a spade, I could dig like Ben Weatherstaff and make a little garden if he gave me seeds. »

Martha's face lit up. « Mother said that! She said you should have a bit of garden, even if you only grow parsley and radishes. »

« How much would a little spade cost?" Mary asked.

« At Thwaite village, they sell little garden sets with a spade, rake, and fork for two shillings. »

« I have more than that," said Mary. « I get a shilling a week to spend. »

« That’s riches! » said Martha. « You can buy anything. In the shop at Thwaite, they sell packets of flower seeds for a penny each, and Dickon knows which are the prettiest and how to grow them. Can you print letters?"

« I can write," Mary answered.

« Dickon can only read printing. If you could print, we could write to him and ask him to buy the tools and seeds. »

« Oh, you’re a good girl! » Mary cried. « I can print if I try. Let’s ask Mrs. Medlock for paper and ink. »

« I have some of my own," said Martha.

Mary twisted her hands together, excited. « If I have a spade, I can make the earth soft and dig up weeds. If I have seeds and can make flowers grow, the garden won't be dead – it will come alive! »

That afternoon, she stayed inside, printing a letter to Dickon that Martha dictated.

« We’ll put the money in the envelope, and the butcher’s boy can take it," said Martha.

« How will I get the things?" asked Mary.

« Dickon will bring them himself. He’ll like the walk. »

« Oh! » exclaimed Mary, « then I shall see him! I never thought I should see Dickon. »

« Do you want to see him?" asked Martha, noticing Mary's happiness.

« Yes, I do. I've never seen a boy that foxes and crows loved. »

Martha remembered something. « I forgot to tell you! I asked Mother if you could come to our cottage for oat cake, butter, and milk. She’s asked Mrs. Medlock. »

It seemed like everything was happening at once. « Does she think Mrs. Medlock will let me go?"

« Yes. She knows Mother keeps a clean house. »

« If I went, I’d see your mother and Dickon," said Mary, liking the idea. « She doesn’t seem like the mothers in India. »

She was quiet that evening. Martha stayed with her until tea, but they didn't talk much. Before leaving, Mary asked, « Martha, has the scullery-maid had a toothache again today?"

Martha started. « Why do you ask?"

« Because when I waited for you, I heard that crying again, like the other night. There isn’t a wind today. »

« You mustn’t walk about in the corridors and listen! » Martha said nervously. « Mr. Craven would be angry. »

« I wasn’t listening," said Mary. « I just heard it. That’s three times. »

« There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell," said Martha, running out.

« It’s the strangest house," said Mary drowsily, falling asleep in her chair. The fresh air, digging, and skipping had made her tired and content.
