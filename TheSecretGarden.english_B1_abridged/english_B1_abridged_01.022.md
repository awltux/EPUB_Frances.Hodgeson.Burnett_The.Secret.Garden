## CHAPTER 22
### When the Sun Went Down
Colin turned to Mary, ordering her to greet their visitor. Dickon watched Colin, noting the bright colour in his cheeks.

"I can stand," Colin announced, holding his head high.

"I told you, you could, once you stopped being afraid," Dickon replied.

"Yes, I've stopped," Colin confirmed. Then, remembering something Mary had said, he asked sharply, "Are you making Magic?"

Dickon grinned. "You're doing Magic yourself. The same Magic that makes these grow." He pointed to crocuses pushing through the earth.

Colin gazed at them. "Yes," he said slowly, "there couldn't be bigger Magic than that." Straightening up, he declared, "I'm going to walk to that tree. I'll stand when Weatherstaff arrives. Bring a rug."

He walked, Dickon supporting him, to the tree. Leaning against it, he looked taller.

When Ben Weatherstaff entered, he saw Colin standing. Mary muttered, "You can do it! You can do it!" willing him to stay upright.

Colin looked beautiful, fixing his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff. "Look at me! Am I a hunchback? Are my legs crooked?"

Ben, still surprised, answered, "No. Nothing like that. What have you been doing, hiding and letting people think you were crippled and half-witted?"

"Half-witted!" Colin snapped. "Who thought that?"

"Lots of fools," Ben said. "Why did you shut yourself away?"

"Everyone thought I was going to die," Colin said. "I'm not!"

Ben examined him. "Die! Nonsense! You've got too much spirit. Sit down a bit, young Master, and give me your orders."

Mary had told Ben about Colin’s recovery and the garden’s importance.

The Rajah sat on the rug. "What work do you do here, Weatherstaff?" he asked.

"Anything I'm told," Ben replied. "I'm kept on because your Mother liked me."

"My Mother?" Colin looked around. "This was her garden, wasn't it?"

"Yes, it was. She loved it."

"It's my garden now. I'll come here every day," Colin announced. "But it's a secret. No one must know we come here. Dickon and my cousin have brought it back to life. I'll send for you sometimes, secretly."

Ben smiled. "I've been here unseen before."

"What!" Colin exclaimed. "When?"

"Last time, about two years ago."

"But no one's been in it for ten years! There was no door!"

"I'm no one," Ben said. "And I came over the wall. Rheumatism stopped me these last two years."

"You did some pruning!" Dickon exclaimed. "I wondered how."

"She loved it," Ben said. "She told me, 'Ben, if I'm ill or go away, take care of my roses.' When she went, no one was allowed near. But I came, over the wall, until the rheumatism stopped me. I did a bit of work each year. She gave her order first."

"It wouldn't be so alive if you hadn't," Dickon said.

"I'm glad you did it, Weatherstaff," Colin said. "You'll keep the secret."

"Yes, sir," Ben answered. "And it's easier for a man with rheumatism to come through the door."

Colin picked up a trowel and began to dig.

"You can do it! You can do it!" Mary whispered.

Dickon watched, curious. Ben looked on with interest.

Colin spoke to Dickon, "You said you'd have me walking and digging. I thought you were lying to please me. It's only the first day, and I've walked and I'm digging."

Ben chuckled. "You've got wits, alright. How'd you like to plant something? I can get you a rose in a pot."

"Go and get it!" Colin said, digging excitedly.

Ben fetched the rose. Dickon dug the hole wider. Mary brought water. Colin turned the earth, flushed with the exercise.

"I want to do it before the sun goes down," he said.

Ben offered the rose. "Here, lad," he said, "plant it yourself, like the King does at a new place."

Colin’s hands shook as he set the rose in the earth, Ben making it firm. Mary watched on her hands and knees.

"It's planted!" Colin said at last. "Help me up, Dickon. I want to be standing when the sun goes down. That's part of the Magic."

Dickon helped him. As the sun set, Colin stood on his feet, laughing.
