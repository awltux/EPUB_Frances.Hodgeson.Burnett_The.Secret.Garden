## CHAPTER 1
### There Is No One Left
When Mary Lennox arrived at Misselthwaite Manor, everyone agreed she was the most unpleasant child they’d ever seen. Thin face, thin body, sour expression, and yellow hair and skin, thanks to being born in India and constantly being ill. Her Father worked for the English Government and was always busy. Her Mother was a great beauty, only interested in parties. She didn’t want a daughter and handed Mary over to an Ayah, instructing her to keep the child out of sight. By six, Mary was a selfish, little tyrant, waited on hand and foot by the native servants. Governesses never lasted long, and Mary only learned to read because she wanted to.

One sweltering morning, when she was about nine years old, Mary woke up in a foul mood, made worse by a strange servant at her bedside. "Where’s my Ayah?" she demanded. The woman, clearly terrified, stammered that the Ayah couldn't come. Mary threw a tantrum, but the woman just repeated, "Not possible."

A strange atmosphere hung in the air. The usual routines were disrupted, servants were missing or scurrying around with frightened faces, but no one would explain anything. Mary was left alone. She wandered into the garden, pretending to make a flowerbed, her anger building. "Pig! Daughter of pigs!" she muttered, the worst insult she knew.

Her Mother appeared on the veranda with a young officer. Mary stared, as always, at her beautiful mother, with her silk hair, delicate nose, laughing eyes, and clothes "full of lace." But today, her eyes weren’t laughing; they were scared.

"Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?" she asked the officer.

"Awfully," he replied, his voice trembling. "Awfully, Mrs. Lennox. You should’ve gone to the hills weeks ago."

Her Mother wrung her hands. "I know! I stayed for that silly dinner party. What a fool!"

A sudden, loud wailing erupted from the servants' quarters. Her Mother grabbed the officer’s arm, and Mary shivered.

"What is it?" she gasped.

"Someone has died," the officer said. "You didn’t say it had broken out among your servants."

"I didn’t know!" her Mother cried, running back inside.

That day, Mary understood the mysterious atmosphere. Cholera. People were dying like flies. The Ayah had died during the night. Panic spread.

For two days, Mary hid in the nursery, forgotten. She cried, slept, and heard frightening sounds. Once, she found the dining room empty, a half-finished meal on the table. She ate some fruit and biscuits, then drank a glass of sweet wine. It made her drowsy, and she fell into a deep sleep, oblivious to the chaos around her.

When she woke, the house was silent. She’d never known it so quiet. Had everyone recovered? Who would care for her now the Ayah was gone? She wasn't upset about her nurse’s death; she wasn’t an affectionate child. The cholera had frightened her, and she was angry that no one seemed to remember her.

Still, no one came. A little snake rustled across the floor, its eyes like jewels. She wasn’t scared; it seemed eager to leave.

"How queer and quiet," she said. "Sounds like it’s just me and the snake."

Then, she heard men’s footsteps on the veranda. They entered the bungalow, their voices low. They opened doors, looking into rooms.

"What desolation!" one said. "That pretty woman! And the child, I suppose. I heard there was one."

Mary stood in the nursery as they opened the door. She was frowning, hungry and feeling neglected. The first man, an officer she recognised, looked startled.

"Barney!" he exclaimed. "A child! Alone! In this place! Who is she?"

"I am Mary Lennox," she said stiffly, annoyed that he called her Father’s house "this place!" "I fell asleep during the cholera and just woke up. Why doesn’t anyone come?"

"The child no one ever saw!" he said to his companion. "She’s been forgotten!"

"Why?" Mary demanded, stamping her foot.

The young man, Barney, looked at her sadly, his eyes glistening. "Poor little kid," he said. "There’s no one left to come."

That's how Mary discovered her parents had died, and the surviving servants had fled, forgetting her. She was alone in the bungalow with only a little snake for company.
