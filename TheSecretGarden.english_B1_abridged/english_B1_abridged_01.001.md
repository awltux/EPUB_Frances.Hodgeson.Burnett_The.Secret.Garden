## CHAPTER 1
### There Is No One Left
Everyone thought Mary Lennox was the most unpleasant child ever. She was skinny, with a sour face and yellow hair and skin, because she'd been born in India and was always sick. Her father worked for the British government and was always busy, and her mother was beautiful but only cared about parties. She didn't want a daughter, so Mary was raised by an Ayah, who kept her out of sight. As Mary grew, she became a selfish and demanding child. Governesses never stayed long because they disliked her so much.

One hot morning, Mary woke up feeling angry because her Ayah wasn't there. The new servant looked scared and said the Ayah couldn't come. Mary threw a tantrum, but the servant only repeated that the Ayah was unavailable. The atmosphere felt strange, with missing servants and fearful faces.

Later, Mary saw her mother on the veranda with a young officer. Her mother, always dressed in beautiful, lacy clothes, looked scared and asked the officer if things were very bad. He replied that they were awful and she should have gone away weeks ago. Just then, loud wailing came from the servants' quarters.

Soon, Mary learned the truth: cholera had broken out, and people were dying. The Ayah had died during the night. Panic spread, and Mary was left alone in the nursery, forgotten by everyone.

She wandered into the dining room, ate some leftover food, and drank a glass of wine. The wine made her sleepy, and she fell into a deep sleep, unaware of the chaos around her.

When Mary woke up, the house was silent. She wondered if the cholera was over and who would care for her now. She wasn't upset about her Ayah's death, as she wasn't a loving child. She noticed a little snake in her room.

Suddenly, she heard men's voices. They entered the bungalow, opening doors and looking into rooms. One of them said, "What desolation! That pretty woman! And the child, too, I suppose."

They found Mary in the nursery. She was frowning because she was hungry and felt neglected. The officer was shocked and asked who she was.

"I am Mary Lennox," she said. "I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just woken up. Why does nobody come?"

The officer looked at her sadly and said, "Poor little kid! There is nobody left to come."

Mary discovered that her parents had died and the remaining servants had fled, forgetting about her. She was alone in the bungalow with the snake.
