## CHAPTER 15
### Nest Building
After a week of rain, the sun reappeared, hot and strong. Mary had spent enjoyable days with Colin, talking about India, gardens, or Dickon. They looked at books together, Mary reading sometimes, Colin at others. When entertained, he barely seemed ill, except for his pale face and constant rest on the sofa.

Mrs. Medlock had noticed the change. "You're a sly one, sneaking about at night," she said, "But it's been a blessing. He hasn't had a tantrum since you two became friends. The nurse was ready to quit, but she's staying now you're keeping Colin company."

Mary was careful when speaking about the secret garden with Colin. Firstly, she wanted to know if he could keep a secret. Secondly, could he be taken to the garden without anyone noticing? The doctor had said he needed fresh air and Colin wanted to visit the secret garden. Mary hoped that fresh air and Dickon's company might make him think less about dying. She had noticed she looked healthier since arriving at Misselthwaite; even Martha had commented on her improved appearance.

"The air's done you good," Martha said. "You're not so yellow or scrawny. Your hair has life in it."

"I'm growing stronger," Mary replied.

"Looks like it," Martha agreed, "You're not half as ugly when you've got some colour in your face."

If gardens helped her, maybe they could help Colin, but perhaps he wouldn't like Dickon seeing him.

"Why do you hate being looked at?" Mary asked one day.

"I always have," he answered. "When I was little, people stared at me, whispering that I wouldn't live long. Ladies would pat my cheeks, saying, 'Poor child!' Once, I bit a lady's hand, and she ran away."

"She thought you were mad," Mary said, unimpressed.

"I don't care," Colin replied, frowning.

"Why didn't you bite me when I came into your room?" Mary asked, smiling.

"I thought you were a ghost," he said. "You can't bite a ghost, and they don't care if you scream."

"Would you mind if a boy looked at you?" Mary asked carefully.

He considered this. "There's one boy I wouldn't mind: Dickon, who knows where the foxes live."

"I'm sure you wouldn't," Mary agreed.

"Animals don't mind him," Colin said, "Perhaps that's why. He's an animal charmer, and I'm a boy animal."

They laughed, finding the idea funny. Mary realised she didn't need to worry about Dickon meeting Colin.

The next morning, the sky was blue again, and the sun streamed in. Mary jumped out of bed and opened the window. A rush of fresh, scented air filled the room. The moor looked magical. Birds chirped everywhere.

"It's warm!" Mary said. "It will make everything grow!"

She leaned out, breathing deeply, remembering Dickon's mother's words about his nose twitching.

"It must be early," she said. "No one is up."

Suddenly, she decided, "I can't wait! I'm going to see the garden!"

She dressed quickly, found a side door, and ran outside. The grass was green, the sun shone, and birds sang. She felt joyful and ran towards the secret garden.

"It's all different!" she exclaimed. "The grass is greener. I am sure Dickon will come this afternoon."

The rain had made the garden bloom. Crocuses were opening. Mary noticed everything now.

As she reached the ivy-covered door, she heard a crow. On the wall sat a large, black bird, looking at her. She was nervous, but it flew away into the garden. She entered, wondering if it would stay. She saw the crow land on an apple tree, beneath which lay a fox. Both watched Dickon kneeling on the grass.

Mary ran to him. "Oh, Dickon! How did you get here so early?"

He stood up, laughing, his eyes bright. "I was up before the sun! The world's begun again. I ran across the moor, shouting and singing. I couldn't stay away."

Mary panted, "I'm so happy I can scarcely breathe!"

The fox came to Dickon, and the crow landed on his shoulder.

"This is Captain, the fox cub," he said. "And this is Soot. They felt the same as me."

The animals weren't afraid of Mary. Dickon walked around the garden, Soot on his shoulder and Captain at his side.

"See here!" Dickon said, pointing to new shoots. "Look at these!"

They knelt, finding crocuses in bloom. Mary kissed them.

"You never kiss a person like that," she said. "Flowers are different."

He looked puzzled but smiled. "I've kissed Mother like that after a day on the moor."

They explored, whispering, discovering wonders. Dickon showed her buds on rose branches and new green shoots. They sniffed the earth, laughing quietly.

The garden was full of joy. Then, a small red-breasted bird flew in with something in its beak. Dickon put his hand on Mary's arm.

"We mustn't move," he whispered. "It's Ben Weatherstaff's robin. He's building his nest. He'll stay if we don't scare him."

They sat still. "We must look like grass and trees," Dickon said. "Then he'll get used to us."

Mary wasn't sure how to look like grass, but Dickon seemed to know.

"It's springtime," he said softly. "They've got their way of doing things. You can lose a friend if you're too curious."

"If we talk about him, I can't help looking," Mary whispered. "I want to tell you something."

"He'll like it better if we talk of something else," Dickon said. "What is it?"

"Do you know about Colin?" she whispered.

He looked at her. "What do you know?"

"I've seen him every day this week. He wants me to come. I'm making him forget about being ill," Mary answered.

Dickon looked relieved. "I'm glad. I didn't like hiding things."

"Don't you like hiding the garden?" said Mary.

"I'll never tell," he answered. "But I told Mother I had a secret."

"How did you know about Colin?" asked Mary.

"Everyone knew about a crippled lad that Mr. Craven didn't like to talk about. Mrs. Medlock talks to my mother. How did you find out? Martha was worried because you were asking questions."

Mary told him about the wind and the crying that led her to Colin's room. Dickon shook his head at her description of Colinâ€™s face.

"His eyes are like his mother's, but hers were always laughing," he said. "They say Mr. Craven can't bear to see him awake because of it."

"Do you think he wants him to die?" whispered Mary.

"No, but he wishes he'd never been born. Mother says that's the worst thing for a child. Mr. Craven would buy anything for him, but he wants to forget he exists. He's afraid Colin will grow hunchbacked."

"Colin's afraid of it himself," said Mary. "He says he'd scream himself to death if he felt a lump."

"He shouldn't think like that," said Dickon. "No lad could get well thinking that."

The fox lay nearby, and Dickon rubbed its neck. He looked around the garden.

"When we came here, everything was gray. Is it different now?"

Mary gasped. "The gray wall is changing! It's like a green mist!"

"Aye," said Dickon. "It'll be greener. I was thinking, if Colin was here, he wouldn't be watching for lumps; he'd be watching for buds. I was wondering if we could get him out here in his carriage."

"I've been wondering that too," said Mary. "If he could keep a secret and if we could bring him here without anyone seeing us. Perhaps you could push his carriage. He must have fresh air. Maybe they'd be glad if he went out with us."

Dickon thought hard. "It'd be good for him. We'd be two children watching a garden grow, and he'd be another. It'd be better than doctor's stuff."

"He's been in his room so long that it's made him strange," said Mary. "He knows books but nothing else. He hates gardens, but he likes hearing about this secret one. I daren't tell him much, but he wants to see it."

"We'll have him out here sometime," said Dickon. "I could push his carriage. Look at the robin working. He knows how to build that nest."

He whistled to the robin, who looked at him. Dickon spoke kindly.

"Wherever you put it, it'll be all right. Get on with it, lad. You've got no time to lose."

"Oh, I like hearing you talk to him!" Mary said. "Ben Weatherstaff scolds him, but he understands every word."

Dickon laughed. "You know we won't trouble you," he said to the robin. "We're nearly wild things ourselves. We're nest-building too. Look out you don't tell on us."

The robin flew away with his twig, and Mary knew he wouldn't tell their secret.
