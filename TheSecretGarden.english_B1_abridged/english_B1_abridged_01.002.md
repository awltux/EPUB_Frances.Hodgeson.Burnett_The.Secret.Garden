## CHAPTER 2
### Mistress Mary Quite Contrary
Mary used to watch her Mother from afar, thinking her beautiful. But they weren't close, so Mary didn’t miss her when she died. Mary was focused on herself, wondering if the people she was going to live with would be nice and let her have her way, like her Ayah did.

She knew she wouldn't stay with the English clergyman. He was poor, with five children who fought all the time. Mary hated their messy house. The children gave her a nickname that made her furious.

It was Basil who started it. He teased her while she made a garden out of mud.

"Why not add stones and call it a rockery?" he suggested.

"Go away!" Mary shouted.

Basil began to sing and dance around her:

> Mistress Mary, quite contrary,
> How does your garden grow?
> With silver bells, and cockle shells,
> And marigolds all in a row.

The other children joined in, and the angrier Mary got, the louder they sang. They called her "Mistress Mary Quite Contrary" from then on.

"You're going home at the end of the week," Basil said. "And we're happy about it."

"I am, too," Mary replied. "Where is home?"

"She doesn't know where home is!" Basil scoffed. "It's England, of course. You're going to your uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven."

"I don't know anything about him," Mary snapped.

"No one does," Basil replied. "He lives in a big, sad, old house, and he's so grumpy no one visits. He's a hunchback and horrible."

Mary put her fingers in her ears, but later, she couldn't help thinking about it. That night, Mrs. Crawford told her she was going to England to live with Mr. Archibald Craven at Misselthwaite Manor. Mary looked so uninterested that they didn't know what to think. She refused Mrs. Crawford's kiss and stayed stiff when Mr. Crawford patted her.

"She's not a pretty child," Mrs. Crawford later confided to her husband. "And her mother was so beautiful. The children call her 'Mistress Mary Quite Contrary' which is understandable. Her mother never paid her much attention," she sighed. "After the Ayah died, no one cared for the poor thing. Imagine the servants running away and leaving her alone."

Mary travelled to England with an officer's wife, who was busy with her own children. In London, a woman named Mrs. Medlock met them. She was Mr. Craven’s housekeeper, a stout woman with red cheeks and sharp black eyes. Mary didn't like her, and it seemed Mrs. Medlock didn't think much of Mary either.

"She's not much to look at!" said Mrs. Medlock to the officers wife. "And her mother was a beauty!"

"Maybe she'll improve," the officer's wife said kindly.

"She'll need to," Mrs. Medlock replied. "There's nothing to improve children at Misselthwaite."

Mary watched the buses and cabs outside the window. Overhearing Mrs. Medlocks comments she thought her the most unpleasant person she'd ever met, but she wondered about her uncle and his house. What was a hunchback? She'd never seen one.

She felt lonely, wondering why she never seemed to belong anywhere. Other children had parents who cared for them, but she only had servants and things. She didn't realise it was because she was unpleasant.

The next day, they travelled to Yorkshire. Mary walked ahead of her at the train station, not wanting to be associated with her. Mrs. Medlock didn't care. She "stood no nonsense from young ones" and was only there because Mr. Craven had told her to fetch Mary. 

"Captain Lennox and his wife died of cholera," Mr. Craven had said. "The child must be brought here." So she obeyed.

Mary sat in her corner of the train, plain and annoyed. She had nothing to read. Her black dress made her look even more yellow, and her hair hung limply from under her hat.

"She’s a spoiled one," Mrs. Medlock thought as she began to talk. "I'll tell you about where you're going. Do you know anything about your uncle?"

"No," said Mary.

"Never heard your parents talk about him?"

"No," Mary said, frowning as she remembered that her parents never talked to her much.

"Humph," Mrs. Medlock muttered. "You're going to a strange place."

Mary said nothing, but she listened.

"It's a big, gloomy place, and Mr. Craven's proud of it in his own way. The house is six hundred years old, on the edge of a moor, with nearly a hundred rooms, mostly locked. There are old pictures, furniture, a big park, and gardens. But there's nothing else."

Mary was interested despite herself. It sounded different from India. But she didn't show it.

"Well," said Mrs. Medlock. "What do you think?"

"Nothing," she answered. "I don't know about such places."

Mrs. Medlock laughed. "You're like an old woman. Don't you care?"

"It doesn't matter if I do," Mary said.

"You're right," said Mrs. Medlock. "I don't know why you're being kept at Misselthwaite Manor. He won't bother with you. He doesn't bother with anyone." She stopped herself. "He's got a crooked back," she said. "That changed him. He was married."

Mary looked at her, surprised.

"She was sweet and pretty, and he loved her deeply," Mrs. Medlock continued. "People said she married him for his money, but she didn't. When she died—"

Mary jumped.

"Oh! Did she die!" she exclaimed, remembering a fairy tale about a hunchback and a princess. She felt sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.

"Yes, she died," Mrs. Medlock answered. "It made him even stranger. He cares about no one. He mostly stays away, and when he's at Misselthwaite, he locks himself in the West Wing. Only Pitcher sees him."

It sounded like a book, and it didn't cheer Mary up. A house with a hundred locked rooms, on a moor – whatever that was – sounded sad. And a hunchback who locked himself away! She stared out the window. Rain poured down in grey lines. If the pretty wife was alive, she might have made things better, like Mary's mother. But she wasn't there.

"Don't expect to see him," said Mrs. Medlock. "And don't expect people to talk to you. Play and look after yourself. You'll be told which rooms you can enter. There are gardens enough. But don't go wandering about. Mr. Craven won't like it."

"I won't go wandering about," said Mary, feeling less sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven and thinking he deserved his fate.

She stared at the rain. The grey weather made her sleepy, and she fell asleep.
