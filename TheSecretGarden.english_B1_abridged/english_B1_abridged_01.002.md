## CHAPTER 2
### Mistress Mary Quite Contrary
Mary hadn't really loved her mother, so she didn't miss her. She mostly thought about herself. She wondered if she was going to live with nice people who would let her have her own way, like her servants did in India.

She was briefly placed in the care of a clergyman, but she didn't want to stay there. The clergyman was poor, with lots of noisy children who fought all the time. Mary disliked their messy house and was so unpleasant that the children started calling her names.

Basil, a boy with a cheeky face, started singing a rhyme about her: "Mistress Mary, quite contrary." The other children joined in, and Mary got angrier and angrier. Basil told her she was being sent to England to live with her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived in a big, lonely house and was a hunchback.

Mary tried not to listen, but she couldn't help thinking about it. That night, Mrs. Crawford confirmed she would be sailing to England to live with her uncle at Misselthwaite Manor. Mary seemed uninterested, which made Mrs. Crawford pity her. She said Mary's mother was beautiful, but Mary was plain and unlikeable.

Mary travelled to England with an officer's wife. In London, she was met by Mrs. Medlock, Mr. Craven's housekeeper. Mrs. Medlock was a large woman with red cheeks and a purple dress. Mary didn't like her, and Mrs. Medlock didn't seem to think much of Mary either.

Mrs. Medlock commented on Mary's plainness, wondering how she could be the daughter of such a beautiful woman. She mentioned that Misselthwaite Manor wasn't exactly the best place for children. Mary overheard them and became curious about her uncle and his home.

Mary realised she had never felt like she truly belonged to anyone, even when her parents were alive. She had always been taken care of, but no one had really paid attention to her.

On the train to Yorkshire, Mary tried to distance herself from Mrs. Medlock, not wanting to be seen as her daughter. Mrs. Medlock, who wasn't easily bothered, started telling Mary about her new home. Mr. Craven had simply ordered her to fetch Mary, and she dared not question him.

Mrs. Medlock described Misselthwaite Manor as a grand but gloomy place, six hundred years old, with hundreds of rooms, a big park, and old gardens. But she also said there was "nothing else." Mary started listening, curious despite herself.

Mrs. Medlock said that Mr. Craven wouldn't bother with Mary, and that she would have to look after herself. She warned Mary not to wander around the house. Mary, now a little sorry for Mr. Craven, quickly decided he deserved whatever bad things had happened to him.

As the rain poured down outside the train window, Mary imagined the dreary house and the lonely hunchback. She stared at the rain until she fell asleep.
