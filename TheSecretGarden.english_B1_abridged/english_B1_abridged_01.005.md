## CHAPTER 5
### The Cry in the Corridor
Each day at Misselthwaite Manor blurred into the next. Mary Lennox woke, watched Martha light the fire, ate breakfast in the dull nursery, and stared out at the endless moor. Bored, she went outside, not realising that running along the paths and fighting the wind, was making her stronger. She only ran to get warm, hating the wind that pushed against her. Yet, the wild, fresh air filled her lungs, bringing colour to her cheeks and life to her eyes.

One morning, after days spent outdoors, Mary woke up hungry and ate her porridge without complaint.

"You got on well enough with that this morning, didn't you?" Martha commented.

"It tastes nice today," Mary admitted, surprised.

"It's the air of the moor giving you an appetite," Martha replied. "You go on playing out of doors every day, and you'll get some flesh on your bones and you won't be so yellow."

"I don't play," said Mary. "I have nothing to play with."

"Nothing to play with!" exclaimed Martha. "Our children play with sticks and stones. They just run about and shout and look at things."

Mary looked at things. There was little else to do. She walked around the gardens and paths. She sometimes looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but he was always too busy or grumpy to pay her attention.

She often visited the long walk outside the walled gardens. Ivy grew thickly against one part of the wall, untrimmed and wild. One day, noticing this, Mary saw a flash of red and heard a chirp. Ben Weatherstaff’s robin perched on the wall, tilting its head.

"Oh!" she cried. "Is it you?" It felt natural to speak to him as if he understood.

He chirped and hopped, and Mary felt she understood him. "Good morning! Isn’t the wind nice? Isn’t the sun nice?"

Mary laughed and chased him as he flew along the wall. For a moment, the thin, sallow Mary looked almost pretty. "I like you!" she called. The robin seemed pleased and flew to a treetop beyond the wall, singing loudly.

Mary remembered seeing him on that tree from the orchard. "It’s the garden no one can go into," she realised. "The garden without a door. He lives in there. How I wish I could see what it is like!"

She ran to the green door, then through the orchard. The tree was on the other side of the wall. "It is the garden," she said to herself. "I am sure it is." She searched for a door but found nothing. "It’s very queer. Ben Weatherstaff said there was no door, and there is no door. But there must have been one ten years ago, because Mr Craven buried the key."

This thought intrigued her. The fresh moor wind was clearing the cobwebs from her mind. That evening, she felt hungry, drowsy, and almost content. She even felt like talking to Martha.

"Why did Mr Craven hate the garden?" she asked.

Martha settled down on the hearthrug. "Does that garden torment you?" she said. "I knew it would. That was just the way with me when I first heard about it."

"Why did he hate it?" Mary persisted.

"Listen to the wind wuthering round the house," Martha said. "You couldn't stand up on the moor tonight."

Mary had never heard of "wuthering", but it perfectly described the shuddering roar that surrounded the house.

"But why did he hate it so?" she asked again.

Martha hesitated. "Mrs Medlock said it's not to be talked about. But for the garden, he wouldn’t be like he is. It was Mrs Craven’s garden, and she loved it. They used to tend the flowers together. They'd go in and shut the door and stay there for hours, reading and talking. There was an old tree with a branch like a seat. She made roses grow over it and she used to sit there. One day, the branch broke, and she fell and was hurt so badly that she died. That's why he hates it. No one’s ever gone in since."

Mary listened to the wind while she mulled over the sad story and how she had been changed by her time at Misselthwaite Manor. She had understood a robin, run in the wind, felt hungry, and felt sorry for someone.

Then, she heard another sound, like a child crying. "Do you hear anyone crying?" she asked Martha.

Martha looked confused. "No," she answered. "It's the wind."

"But listen," said Mary. "It’s in the house—down one of those long corridors."

Suddenly, a door downstairs opened, creating a rushing draft. The door of their room crashed open, the light blew out, and the crying sound swept down the corridor.

"There!" said Mary. "I told you so! It is someone crying—and it isn’t a grown-up person."

Martha shut the door and locked it. They heard another door slam in the distance. Then, silence.

"It was the wind," Martha insisted, "Or little Betty Butterworth, the scullery-maid. She's had the toothache all day."

But Mary stared at her, unconvinced. She knew Martha wasn't telling the truth.
