## CHAPTER 23
### Magic
Dr. Craven looked worried as Colin returned. "You stayed out too long," he said. "You mustn't push yourself."

"I feel fine," Colin declared. "I'm going out tomorrow too."

Dr. Craven hesitated. "I'm not sure that's wise."

"It's wise for me," Colin insisted.

Mary watched Dr. Craven leave, a thought striking her. "I almost feel sorry for him."

"So do I," Colin replied, pleased. "He won't inherit Misselthwaite now I'm not dying."

"No, I meant... it must have been awful to be polite to such a rude boy for so long. I wouldn't have."

"Am I rude?" Colin asked, unbothered.

"If you were his son, he would have smacked you."

"But he wouldn't dare!"

Mary nodded. "No one ever dared, because you were supposed to be dying. You were a 'poor thing'."

"I'm not going to be a 'poor thing'," Colin stated. "I stood on my feet today!"

"Having your own way is what's made you so odd," Mary observed.

Colin frowned. "Am I odd?"

"Yes, very. But so am I.  Once I started liking people and found the garden I became less odd."

"I don't want to be odd," Colin said, determined.

He fell silent, then his face lit up with a smile. "I'll stop being odd if I go to the garden every day. There's Magic there, Mary. Good Magic."

"I think so too."

"Even if it's not real Magic, we can pretend. Something's there!"

"It is Magic," Mary insisted, "but not bad. It's as white as snow."

The next months proved her right. The garden exploded with life. Green shoots pushed through the earth, and buds burst into every colour imaginable. Flowers filled every space.

Ben Weatherstaff would say, "She loved flowers pointing to the sky. She loved the earth, but the blue sky always made her happy."

The seeds Dickon and Mary planted thrived, as if fairies tended them. Roses climbed everywhere, their scent filling the air.

Colin watched it all, fascinated. He spent hours in the garden, even on grey days. He watched the plants grow and the insects scurrying about. He learned about moles, ants, bees, frogs, birds, and plants. Dickon added foxes, otters, squirrels, and more to his knowledge.

The fact that he'd stood on his feet had changed Colin. He loved Mary's "spell" and talked about Magic constantly.

"There must be Magic in the world," he said. "People just don't know how to use it. Maybe it starts with saying nice things will happen."

The next morning, Colin summoned Ben Weatherstaff and declared, "I'm going to do a scientific experiment about Magic! I'm going to make discoveries."

Ben touched his forehead respectfully.

"Magic is everywhere," Colin continued. "We just don't know how to use it, like electricity or horses. When Mary found this garden, it was dead. Now, things are growing. I'm curious! Scientific people are always curious. It's Magic! The Magic in this garden made me stand. I'm going to get some Magic and make it strong. I'll say, 'Magic is in me! Magic is making me well! I'm going to be as strong as Dickon!' You must all do it too!"

"Aye, aye, sir!" Ben agreed.

"Say it over and over, and it will become part of you," Colin instructed.

"I heard about holy men in India who say words thousands of times," Mary chimed in.

Ben said, "I've heard Jem Fettleworth's wife say things over and over, calling Jem a drunken brute. And so he is!"

Colin thought. "Well, something came of it! But she used the wrong Magic! If she'd said something nice, maybe he wouldn't have got so drunk."

Ben chuckled. "You're a clever lad, Mester Colin. I'll give Bess Fettleworth a hint."

Dickon smiled. "It'll work like the sun on seeds. Shall we start now?"

Colin confessed he was tired and suggested they sit cross-legged under the tree. "It will be like a temple."

"Eh!" Dickon protested. "Don't start by saying you're tired. You might spoil the Magic!"

"That's true," Colin agreed. "I must only think of the Magic."

The group formed a circle. Ben felt like he was at a prayer meeting, but since it was the Rajah's idea, he didn't mind. Mary felt enchanted. Dickon held his rabbit, and the animals gathered around.

"The 'creatures' have come," Colin announced. "They want to help us."

Colin looked beautiful, like a priest. "Now, we'll begin."

"I can't do any swaying," Ben complained. "I've got the rheumatics."

"The Magic will take them away," Colin declared. "We'll only chant."

"I can't do any chanting," Ben said. "They kicked me out of the choir."

Everyone was serious. "Then I will chant," Colin said. "The sun is shining; that is the Magic! The flowers are growing; that is the Magic! Being alive is the Magicâ€”being strong is the Magic! The Magic is in me! Magic, come and help!"

He repeated it many times. Mary felt both strange and wonderful. Ben started to doze. Dickon sat still, his rabbit asleep on his arm. Finally, Colin stopped.

"Now, I'm going to walk round the garden."

Ben woke with a start. "Nothing of the sort. The sermon was good, but I'm bound to get out before the collection."

"You're not in church," Colin pointed out.

"Not me. I heard every bit of it. You said the Magic was in my back. The doctor calls it rheumatics."

"That was the wrong Magic," Colin said. "You'll get better. Go to your work, but come back tomorrow."

"I'd like to see thee walk round the garden," Ben grumbled, not entirely convinced.

A procession formed. Colin led, with Dickon and Mary beside him. Ben followed, and the animals trailed behind.

It moved slowly. Colin leaned on Dickon, but sometimes he walked alone, head held high.

"The Magic is in me! The Magic is making me strong! I can feel it!"

He walked around the entire garden. When he returned, his cheeks were flushed.

"I did it! The Magic worked! That's my first scientific discovery!"

"What will Dr. Craven say?" Mary asked.

"He won't be told," Colin said. "This is a secret until I'm strong enough to run. I'll come here every day in my chair, and I'll be taken back in it. When Father comes back, I'll walk into his study and say, 'Here I am; I'm like any other boy. A scientific experiment did it.'"

"He'll think he's dreaming!"

Colin imagined his father's face, a powerful motivator. "He'll have to believe it! Before I make scientific discoveries, I'm going to be an athlete!"

"We'll have you boxing soon," Ben joked.

Colin frowned. "Weatherstaff, that's disrespectful. I won't be a prizefighter. I'll be a Scientific Discoverer."

"Asking your pardon, sir," Ben said, secretly pleased that Colin was gaining strength and spirit.
