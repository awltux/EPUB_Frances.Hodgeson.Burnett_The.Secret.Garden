## CHAPTER 3
### Across the Moor
Mary slept on the train, waking up to chicken, beef, and tea with Mrs. Medlock. The rain was heavy, and everyone looked wet. Later, she woke up again at Thwaite Station. The stationmaster spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a strange accent that Mary later learned was Yorkshire.

A smart carriage waited outside. As they drove off, Mary wondered about the house Mrs. Medlock had mentioned. It had a hundred rooms and stood on a moor.

"What is a moor?" she asked.

"Look out the window," Mrs. Medlock replied. "We're driving across Missel Moor. It’s miles of wild land."

The carriage lamps lit the rough road. A wind howled.

"It sounds like the sea," Mary said.

"It's the wind," Mrs. Medlock answered. "A wild, dreary place."

The horses climbed uphill. Mary saw a light.

"It's the lodge window," Mrs. Medlock said.

After the park gates, they drove through a long, dark avenue to a large, low house. Only one room upstairs had a light.

The front door was huge. Inside, the hall was dim, with portraits that made Mary uneasy. She felt small and lost.

An old man told Mrs. Medlock to take Mary to her room. "He doesn't want to see her," he said. "He’s going to London."

Mary was led up stairs, down corridors, and finally into a room with a fire and supper.

Mrs. Medlock said, "This room and the next are yours. Stay in them!"

That was how Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor, feeling more stubborn than ever.
