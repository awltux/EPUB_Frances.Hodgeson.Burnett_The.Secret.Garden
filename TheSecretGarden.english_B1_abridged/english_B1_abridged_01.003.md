## CHAPTER 3
### Across the Moor
Mary slept, waking to a lunch of bread, chicken and beef. Rain lashed the train windows. At Thwaite Station, the stationmaster greeted Mrs. Medlock in a strange accent. "I see you have brought the young one."

A smart carriage waited. Inside, Mary stared out, driven towards a house with a hundred shut rooms, on the edge of a moor. "What is a moor?" she asked.

"Look out in ten minutes," Mrs. Medlock said. "It's five miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor."

Darkness pressed against the windows. After a village with whitewashed houses and a church, the horses slowed, climbing. "Eh! We're on the moor now," Mrs. Medlock said.

The carriage lamps showed a rough road through low bushes. A wild wind roared around them. "It's, it's not the sea, is it?" Mary asked.

"No, miles of wild land," Mrs. Medlock answered, "heather and gorse, wild ponies and sheep."

The carriage jolted over bridges, water roaring beneath. Mary felt the drive would never end. "I don’t like it," she muttered.

Eventually a light appeared, a sigh of relief from Mrs. Medlock. "The lodge window. We'll get a good cup of tea soon."

Through the park gates, a long, dark avenue finally led to a sprawling house around a stone court. A single, dull light glowed upstairs.

The heavy oak door opened to a vast hall, dimly lit. Portraits and armour loomed, making Mary feel small and lost.

An old man spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a husky voice. "Take her to her room. He doesn't want to see her. Going to London in the morning."

"Make sure he’s not disturbed," Mr. Pitcher added.

Mary was led up stairs and down corridors, until a door opened to a room with a fire and a supper.

Mrs. Medlock said, "Here you are! This room and the next are yours, and you must keep to them. Don't you forget!"

And so, Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor, feeling as contrary as ever.
