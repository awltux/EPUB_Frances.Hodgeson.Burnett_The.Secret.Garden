## CHAPTER 18
### We Must Get Him Out Here
Mary woke up late. Martha said Colin was still ill after his tantrum, but he really wanted to see Mary.

"He's taken a fancy to you," Martha said. "He even said 'please'! Will you go, Miss?"

"I'll see him now," Mary said, having an idea.

Colin looked pale when she arrived. "I'm glad you came," he said. "My head aches. Are you going out?"

Mary leaned on his bed. "I'm going to Dickon, but I'll come back. It's about the secret garden."

Colin's face lit up. "I dreamt about it all night! I dreamt of green leaves and birds. I'll think about it until you return."

Five minutes later, Mary was with Dickon in the garden. Squirrels jumped onto his shoulders when he said their names, Nut and Shell.

It was hard to leave, but Mary told her story. Dickon looked sadder than she felt for Colin.

"Listen to them birds!" Dickon exclaimed. "The world's calling! He's shut up inside. We must get him out here, watching, listening, soaked in sunshine. And quickly!"

When excited, Dickon spoke broader Yorkshire. Mary loved it and tried to speak it too.

"Aye, that we must," Mary agreed. "He likes you. I'll ask if you can visit tomorrow with your animals. Later, we'll bring him here in his chair and show him everything."

Dickon grinned. "Talk Yorkshire to him! It'll make him laugh, and that's the best medicine."

"I will!" Mary declared.

The garden was bursting with life. Back in Colin's room, he sniffed the air.

"You smell like flowers and fresh things!" he exclaimed. "It's cool, warm, and sweet."

"It's the wind from the moor," Mary said. "It's from sitting with Dickon, Captain, Soot, Nut, and Shell. It's springtime and sunshine." She spoke as much Yorkshire as she could.

Colin laughed. "What are you doing? I've never heard you talk like that!"

"I'm giving you a bit of Yorkshire," Mary replied.

They laughed until they could not stop themselves. Mrs. Medlock was amazed to hear the two of them as she stood outside the room.

They talked about Dickon, Captain, Soot, Nut, Shell, and Jump the pony. Mary had seen Jump; a shaggy pony who understood Dickon.

"Does he really understand everything Dickon says?" Colin asked.

"Yes. Dickon says anything will understand if you are friends for sure," Mary answered.

Colin was quiet, thinking. "I wish I was friends with things. I can't bear people."

"Can't you bear me?" Mary asked.

"Yes, I like you," he replied. 

"Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him," Mary said. "We're both sour. But I don't feel as sour since I met the robin and Dickon."

"Did you hate people?"

"Yes," Mary said. "I'd have hated you before I met the robin and Dickon."

Colin touched her hand. "I wish I hadn't said about sending Dickon away. I hated you when you said he was like an angel, but maybe he is."

"It was funny to say," she admitted. "But if there was a Yorkshire angel, he'd understand green things and talk to wild creatures, like Dickon."

"I want to see Dickon," said Colin.

"I'm glad," Mary replied, knowing it was time to tell him everything. "Because..."

"Because what?" he asked.

Mary held his hands. "Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him. Can I trust you for sure?"

"Yes!" he whispered.

"Dickon will come tomorrow with his animals."

"Oh!" Colin cried.

"There's more," Mary said, excited. "There's a door into the garden under the ivy."

Colin gasped. "Shall I see it? Shall I get into it? Shall I live to get into it?"

"Of course!" Mary snapped. "Don't be silly!"

She told him about the garden, and he forgot his aches.

"It's just as you thought," he said. "It sounds like you've seen it."

Mary hesitated, then said, "I have seen it. I've been in. I found the key weeks ago. But I didn't trust you for sure!"
