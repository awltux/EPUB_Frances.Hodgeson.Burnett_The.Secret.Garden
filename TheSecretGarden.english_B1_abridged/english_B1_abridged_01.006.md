## CHAPTER 6
### There Was Some One Crying!
Rain lashed against the windows. Mary asked Martha what her family did on days like this.

"Try not to annoy each other," Martha said. "Mother gets stressed, what with so many of us crammed in. The older ones go out into the cowshed and play there. Dickon doesn't care about the rain. Says he sees things others miss." She told of Dickon finding a fox cub, its mother dead, and a crow he named Soot.

Mary, forgetting her usual complaints about Martha, said, "If I had a raven or a fox cub, I could play with it, but I have nothing."

Martha looked puzzled. "Can you knit? Sew? Read?"

"I can read," Mary answered.

"Then read! Or learn spelling. You're old enough."

"I have no books," said Mary. "They're in India."

Martha suggested the library.

Rather than asking Martha or Mrs. Medlock where the library was, Mary decided to find it herself. Mrs. Medlock was always downstairs anyway. This house was strange; you hardly saw anyone. The servants lived well when the master was away, with plentiful food and fun in the kitchen.

No one bothered about Mary. She dressed herself now, as Martha thought her silly to ask for help.

Standing at the window, Mary thought about the library and all the mysterious closed doors. Were there really a hundred rooms? She decided to count them. She didn't know how to ask for permission or what authority was, so she wouldn't have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she could walk around the house.

She wandered into the long corridors. Pictures lined the walls â€“ landscapes and portraits in velvet and satin. One long gallery held so many faces, she felt they watched her, wondering what she was doing there. There were children, too, in strange clothes. One, a plain girl like herself, held a green parrot.

"Where do you live now?" Mary asked her. "I wish you were here."

The house felt empty. It was hard to believe anyone lived there.

On the second floor, she turned a handle. To her surprise, the door opened into a large bedroom with embroidered hangings and a view of the moor. The portrait of the plain girl hung over the fireplace.

"Perhaps she slept here," Mary said. "Her stare makes me feel uneasy."

She opened more doors, finding old pictures, tapestries, and curious furniture. In one room, a lady's sitting room, a hundred ivory elephants filled a cabinet. Mary played with them until tired.

She heard a rustling sound. A tiny grey mouse peeked out of a hole in the sofa cushion. Six baby mice nestled nearby.

"If they weren't so scared, I'd take them with me," said Mary.

Tired, she turned back but soon became lost. Then she heard a child crying. Following the sound, she discovered a hidden door behind a tapestry and opened it to find an angry Mrs. Medlock holding keys.

"What are you doing here?" Mrs. Medlock demanded, pulling her away. "What did I tell you?"

"I got lost and heard someone crying," Mary explained.

"You heard nothing," Mrs. Medlock said. "Back to your room, or I'll box your ears."

She pushed Mary into her room and slammed the door. Mary sat on the hearthrug, grinding her teeth.

"There was someone crying!" she told herself. 

She had heard it twice now. She'd find out who it was. Despite Mrs. Medlock, it had been an interesting morning. She had explored, played with elephants, and seen the mice. It had been an adventure.
