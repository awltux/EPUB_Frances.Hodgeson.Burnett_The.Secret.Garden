## CHAPTER 27
### In the Garden
Centuries have passed, and each one reveals more amazing things than the last. People often doubt new ideas, then hope, then believe, and finally wonder why they weren't done sooner. One recent discovery is the power of thoughts – good ones are like sunlight, bad ones like poison.

Mary Lennox was a miserable child, but circumstances pushed her in a better direction. Her mind filled with images of robins, moorland cottages, Yorkshire folk, springtime, and a secret garden, leaving no room for the sour thoughts that made her ill.

Colin, trapped in his room, focused on fears and weakness. He became a hysterical boy, ignorant of sunshine and spring, unaware he could heal. But new, beautiful thoughts pushed out the old, and life flowed back into him, simple as that.

> "Where you tend a rose, my lad,
> A thistle cannot grow."

While the secret garden and the children bloomed, Archibald Craven wandered, his mind consumed by sorrow for ten years. He hadn't tried to replace dark thoughts, and his gloom poisoned the air around him.

He travelled, seeking remote spots. One day, resting by a stream in the Austrian Tyrol, he gazed at forget-me-nots and felt a tenderness he hadn't felt in years. This simple thought filled his mind, pushing aside the darkness, like a spring clearing a stagnant pool.

"What is it?" he whispered. "I almost feel...alive!"

He didn't understand, but months later, he remembered this hour when he learned that Colin had cried, "I am going to live forever and ever and ever!"

The calmness left, replaced by dark thoughts, but sometimes, the burden lifted, and he felt alive again. He was "coming alive" with the garden.

Autumn found him at Lake Como, where he walked and slept, his dreams less terrifying. "Perhaps," he thought, "my body is growing stronger." His soul was growing stronger too. He thought of Misselthwaite and his son.

One night, by the lake, he fell asleep and dreamed of a voice calling, "Archie! Archie! In the garden!"

He awoke to a servant with letters. One, from Susan Sowerby in Yorkshire, urged him to come home, saying, "I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here."

He decided to return to Misselthwaite, thinking of his son for the first time in years. He remembered his bitterness at the child's birth, his refusal to see him, his horror at the weak, miserable creature with eyes like his dead wife's. He had provided for him, but avoided him, lost in his own misery.

On the train, the man who was "coming alive" realised, "Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years."

He wondered if Susan wrote because Colin was worse, but the calmness gave him courage. "Could she see I might help him?"

Stopping at the Sowerby cottage, he found the children, but Mrs. Sowerby was away helping a new mother and her baby. He gave them money and drove on, the moor offering a sense of homecoming.

Arriving at the Manor, he found the servants respectful and asked for Mrs Medlock.

"How is Master Colin, Medlock?" he asked.

"He's...different," she replied, flustered. "Neither Dr Craven, nor the nurse, nor me can exactly make him out. He ate, then stopped, and refused to be taken outside, but suddenly wanted to go out every day with Miss Mary and Dickon."

"How does he look?"

"If he ate normally, sir, you’d think he was putting on flesh, but we’re afraid it may be a sort of bloat. He laughs sometimes in a queer way when he’s alone with Miss Mary. He never used to laugh at all. Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you’ll allow him. He never was as puzzled in his life.”

"Where is Master Colin now?" Mr. Craven asked.

"In the garden, sir."

"In the garden!"

He went through the shrubbery to the fountain and the Long Walk, drawn to the place he had forsaken. He stopped, listening. Inside the garden, there were sounds of running, laughter, and joyous cries. He was losing his mind!

Then, the door burst open, and a boy dashed out, colliding with him.

He was a tall, handsome boy, glowing with life, with grey eyes rimmed with black lashes. It was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.

"Who...What?" he stammered.

"Father," the boy said, "I'm Colin."

Like Mrs Medlock he did not understand what his father meant when he said hurriedly:

"In the garden! In the garden!”

"Yes," Colin rushed on, "it was the garden that did it, and Mary and Dickon and the creatures, and the Magic. No one knows. We kept it to tell you when you came. I'm well, I can beat Mary in a race. I'm going to be an athlete. Aren't you glad, Father?" he ended. "Aren't you glad? I'm going to live forever and ever and ever!"

Mr Craven held his son. "Take me into the garden, my boy."

The garden was a wilderness of autumn colours. "I thought it would be dead," he said.

"Mary thought so at first," said Colin. "But it came alive."

They sat under the tree, and Colin told his story of magic, creatures, midnight meetings, the coming of spring, and secret companionship. "Now," he said, "it need not be a secret anymore. I am never going to get into the chair again. I shall walk back with you, Father, to the house.”

Ben Weatherstaff, visiting the kitchen, waited for the dramatic event.

"Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?" Mrs Medlock asked.

"Aye, that I did," he answered with a shrewdly significant air.

"Both of them?" suggested Mrs Medlock.

"Both of them,” returned Ben Weatherstaff. "There’s been things going on outside as you house people know nothing about. And what you'll find out, you'll find out soon.”

He pointed to the lawn. "Look there," he said, "if you're curious. Look what’s coming across the grass."

Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite, and by his side, walking as strongly as any boy in Yorkshire, walked Master Colin!
