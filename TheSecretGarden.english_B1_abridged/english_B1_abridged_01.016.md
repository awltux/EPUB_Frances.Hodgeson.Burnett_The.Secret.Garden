## CHAPTER 16
### “I Won’t!” Said Mary
The morning had flown by, and Mary, lost in the garden, was late returning to the house.

"Tell Colin I can't visit yet," she told Martha. "I'm busy in the garden."

Martha looked worried. "He might get upset, Miss Mary."

But Mary, less afraid than others and never one to put herself out for anyone, simply said, "Dickon's waiting," and ran off.

The afternoon sun warmed her as she and Dickon transformed the garden. Weeds vanished, roses and trees were tended to.

"Apple and cherry blossoms soon," Dickon said, his face glowing, "and the grass will be covered in flowers."

The fox and rook played nearby, the robin darting about. The rook flew up to Dickon, cawing excitedly, as if telling tales of his adventures. Mary felt a surge of joy.

"You're stronger," Dickon noted, seeing her digging. "You look different."

Mary felt the sun on her face. "I'm getting fatter! My hair's growing thicker."

As the sun set, painting the trees gold, they parted ways. "I'll be here at sunrise," Dickon said.

"Me too!" Mary replied.

Back in the house, Martha's face was glum.

"What's wrong?" Mary asked. "What did Colin say?"

"He nearly had a tantrum," Martha sighed. "He kept watching the clock."

Mary frowned. She hated that Colin's moods could ruin her day.

Colin wasn't on his sofa but in bed, refusing to look at her.

"Why didn't you get up?" Mary demanded.

"I did, this morning, thinking you'd come," he replied, voice sulky. "My back and head hurt. Why didn't you come?"

"I was in the garden with Dickon."

Colin frowned. "If you spend time with him instead of me, I won't let him come here."

Mary snapped. "If you send Dickon away, I'll never come back here!"

"You will if I want you to," Colin retorted.

"I won't!" said Mary.

"I'll make you. They'll drag you here."

"They can drag me," Mary said, her voice shaking, "but I won't speak. I'll just stare at the floor."

"You're selfish!" Colin cried.

"What are you?" Mary shot back. "You're more selfish! The most selfish boy I know."

"I'm not as selfish as your precious Dickon! He keeps you playing in the dirt while I'm alone."

"He's nicer than anyone," Mary defended. "He's like an angel!"

"An angel? He's just a common boy from the moor!"

"He's better than you!" Mary retorted, her voice rising. "A thousand times better!"

Colin turned away, a tear escaping. "I'm always ill, and I think I have a lump on my back. I'm going to die."

"You're not!" Mary snapped.

He looked up, shocked. "I am! Everyone says so."

"I don't believe it!" Mary said. "You say it to make people feel sorry for you. You're too nasty!"

Colin sat up, anger flaring. "Get out!" He threw a pillow, but it fell short.

"I'm going," Mary said, face tight. "And I won't be back!"

At the door, she turned. "I was going to tell you about Dickon's fox and rook. But now I won't tell you anything!"

She slammed the door to find the nurse outside, laughing.

"What's so funny?" Mary asked.

"You two," the nurse chuckled. "He needs someone to stand up to him. It'll do him good."

"Is he going to die?"

"Who knows?" the nurse shrugged. "He's just spoiled."

Back in her room, Mary's anger simmered. She had wanted to share her day, to trust Colin with the secret of the garden. Now, she wouldn't tell him anything. Let him stay in his room forever!

Martha entered, a wooden box in her hands.

"Mr. Craven sent it," she said. "Looks like books."

Mary remembered his offer of gifts. Inside were beautiful books, games, and a writing case with a gold pen.

Her heart softened. She hadn't expected him to remember her.

"I'll write a thank you letter," she decided.

If she and Colin were friends, she would share these gifts. But he was cross and tired today.

"He'll think about his back," she realised, remembering his fear of a lump.

She paused. "I said I wouldn't go back," she thought, "but maybe… maybe I'll see him in the morning. Even if he throws a pillow at me."
