## CHAPTER 4
### Martha
Mary woke to the sound of the housemaid, Martha, noisily cleaning the fireplace. The room was strange, with tapestry showing scenes of forests and castles. Outside, a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it looked like a dull sea.

"What's that?" Mary asked, pointing.

"That's the moor," Martha replied with a grin. "Don't you like it?"

"No," Mary said. "I hate it."

Martha shrugged. "You'll get used to it. It's lovely in spring, full of sweet-smelling flowers. I wouldn't live anywhere else."

Mary frowned, confused. The servants in India were respectful, almost afraid. This girl spoke as if they were equals. "You're a strange servant," she said haughtily.

Martha laughed, unfazed. "I'm too common for a grand house like this. But this place is different. Mr Craven doesn't care about anything. Mrs Medlock gave me this job out of kindness."

"Are you going to be my servant?" Mary asked.

"I'm Mrs Medlock's servant, but I'll help you a bit. You won't need much."

"Who will dress me?"

Martha stared. "Can't you dress yourself?"

"No. My Ayah always dressed me."

"Well, it's time you learned. It'll do you good. My mother says pampered children turn out fools!"

"It's different in India," Mary said, offended.

"I can see that. I thought you'd be black!"

Mary sat up, furious. "What! You thought I was a native? They're servants who salaam to you. You know nothing about India!"

She threw herself onto the pillows, sobbing. Martha, surprised, knelt beside her.

"Don't cry! I didn't mean to upset you. I don't know anything!"

Her comforting Yorkshire voice calmed Mary. The sobbing stopped.

"Time to get up," Martha said. "Mrs Medlock wants me to take your breakfast to the room next door. It's your nursery now. I'll help you with your clothes."

The clothes Martha chose were colourful, not black. "These aren't mine," Mary said. "Mine are black."

"Mr Craven said he didn't want a child dressed in black. He wants colour."

"I hate black," Mary agreed.

As Martha helped her dress, Mary realised she'd never done anything for herself. "Why don't you put on your own shoes?" Martha asked.

Before breakfast, Mary knew life here would be different. She would have to learn many new things.

In the nursery, a large breakfast was laid out. "I don't want it," Mary said, uninterested.

"You don't want porridge!" Martha exclaimed.

"No."

"I hate to see food wasted. Our children would eat it all in minutes."

"Why?"

"Because they're always hungry."

"I don't know what it is to be hungry," Mary said.

Martha looked annoyed. "You should try it! I wish my brothers and sisters had this."

"Why don't you give it to them?" Mary suggested.

"It's not mine. And today isn't my day off."

Mary ate a little, then went to the window. The gardens looked dull.

"Why should I go out on a day like this?"

"If you don't go out, what will you do in here?"

Mary saw nothing to do. "Who will go with me?"

"You'll have to go by yourself. My brother Dickon plays alone on the moor for hours. That's how he made friends with animals."

The mention of Dickon made Mary curious.

Martha found her coat and showed her the way to the gardens. "One of the gardens is locked up," she said. "No one has been in it for ten years."

"Why?" Mary asked.

"Mr Craven locked it after his wife died. He buried the key." At the sound of a small bell, Martha excused herself and rushed away.

Mary walked towards the gardens, thinking about the locked garden. She found large gardens with bare flowerbeds. This wasn't the closed garden. How could you close a garden?

At the end of a path, she saw a long wall covered in ivy. There was a green door, standing open. This wasn't the closed garden either.

She went through the door into a walled kitchen garden. She saw another green door, and beyond it, more gardens. The place was ugly and bare.

An old man with a spade appeared. He looked surprised, and though he touched his cap in greeting, he otherwise seemed unfriendly.

"What is this place?" Mary asked.

"One of the kitchen gardens," he answered.

"What's that?" Mary asked, pointing to another door.

"Another one. There's more on the other side."

"Can I go in them?"

"If you like. But there's nothing to see."

Mary walked on, through another green door. She found more walls and vegetables. But in the next wall, a green door was closed. Perhaps this was the secret garden. Mary turned the handle. It opened easily.

She found herself in an orchard, surrounded by walls. There was no green door to be seen. The wall seemed to continue beyond the orchard. She could see treetops above it. A red breasted bird sat on one, singing.

His cheerful song made her feel pleased. Even a disagreeable girl could be lonely. The bird made her sour face almost smile. He wasn't like Indian birds.

Perhaps she thought about the deserted garden so much because she had nothing else to do. She wanted to know why Mr Craven had buried the key. If he loved his wife, why did he hate her garden?

"People never like me, and I never like people," she thought.

She remembered the bird, and the treetop he sat on. "I believe that tree was in the secret garden. There was a wall, and no door."

She returned to the old gardener. "I've been into the other gardens," she said.

"There was nothing to stop you," he replied.

"There was no door into the other garden."

"What garden?" he asked.

"The one on the other side of the wall. There are trees there. A red breasted birts was singing there."

The old man's face changed. He smiled. It made her realise how much nicer a person looked when they smiled.

He turned and whistled softly. The bird flew to them, landing near his foot.

"Here he is," the old man chuckled. "Where have you been, cheeky little beggar?" He spoke to the bird as if it were a child.

The bird tilted his head and looked at him, unafraid. He pecked at the earth, looking for food. Mary felt a strange warmth in her heart. He was so cheerful.

"Will he always come when you call him?" she whispered.

"Aye, he will. I've known him since he was a fledgling. He came from the other garden. He was too weak to fly back, and we became friends."

"What kind of bird is he?" Mary asked.

"Don't you know? He's a robin redbreast. They're the friendliest birds alive. They're almost like dogs. He knows everything Mr Craven doesn't bother to find out. He's the head gardener."

The robin hopped about, looking at them curiously. It seemed as if he were finding out about her.

"I'm lonely," Mary said to the robin. She hadn't realised this before.

The old gardener stared at her. "Are you the little girl from India?"

Mary nodded.

"Then no wonder you're lonely. You'll be lonelier before you're done."

He began to dig again.

"What's your name?" Mary asked.

"Ben Weatherstaff," he answered. "I'm lonely myself, except when he's with me." He pointed to the robin. "He's the only friend I've got."

"I have no friends," said Mary. "My Ayah didn't like me, and I never played with anyone."

"You and me are alike," Ben said. "We're both sour-looking and nasty-tempered."

This was the first time Mary had heard the truth about herself. She wondered if she was as unattractive and sour as Ben. She also wondered if she was nasty-tempered. She felt uncomfortable.

Suddenly, the robin burst into song. Ben laughed.

"What did he do that for?" asked Mary.

"He's decided to make friends with you. He's taken a fancy to you."

"To me?" Mary moved closer to the tree. "Would you make friends with me?" she asked the robin, softly.

"Why," Ben cried, "you said that as nicely as a real child! You said it almost like Dickon talks to his wild things on the moor."

"Do you know Dickon?" Mary asked.

"Everybody knows him. Dickon's everywhere. Even the foxes show him their cubs, and the skylarks don't hide their nests from him."

Mary wanted to ask more questions, but the robin flew away.

"He's flown into the garden where there is no door!" Mary cried.

"He lives there," said old Ben. "He came out of the egg there. If he's courting, he's looking for a young madam of a robin that lives among the old rose-trees there."

"Rose-trees," said Mary. "Are there rose-trees?"

Ben took up his spade. "There was ten year ago," he mumbled.

"I should like to see them. Where is the green door? There must be a door somewhere."

Ben looked unfriendly again. "There was ten year ago, but there isn't now."

"No door!" cried Mary. "There must be."

"None as anyone can find. Don't be a meddlesome girl. I have to work. Go and play. I have no more time."

He threw his spade over his shoulder and walked away, without another word.
