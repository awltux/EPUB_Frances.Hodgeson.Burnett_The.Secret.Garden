## CHAPTER 19
### It Has Come!
Dr Craven was called after Colin’s tantrum. The doctor always found Colin pale and sobbing. He dreaded these visits.

“How is he?” Dr Craven asked Mrs Medlock irritably. “He’ll burst a blood vessel one day. He’s half insane.”

“Well,” said Mrs Medlock, “you won’t believe it. That sour-faced Mary has bewitched him. She flew at him like a cat last night and told him to stop screaming. It startled him so much, he stopped. Come and see, sir.”

Dr Craven entered Colin’s room and heard laughing. Colin was sitting up, looking at a garden book with Mary.

“Those blue ones, we’ll have lots of those,” Colin said. “They’re called Delphiniums.”

“Dickon says they’re larkspurs made big,” said Mary. “There are some already.”

They saw Dr Craven and stopped.

“I’m sorry you were ill,” Dr Craven said nervously.

“I’m better,” Colin answered. “I’m going out in my chair soon. I want fresh air.”

Dr Craven felt his pulse. “It must be a very fine day. Don't tire yourself.”

“Fresh air won’t tire me.”

Colin had often screamed that fresh air would kill him. The doctor was surprised.

“I thought you didn’t like fresh air,” he said.

“I don’t when I’m by myself. But my cousin is going with me.”

“And the nurse?”

“No, I won’t have the nurse. My cousin knows how to take care of me. She made me better last night. A strong boy will push my carriage.”

Dr Craven was alarmed. If Colin got well, he would lose his inheritance. But he was a good man and couldn’t let Colin be in danger.

“He must be a strong, steady boy. Who is he?”

“It’s Dickon,” Mary said. Everyone knew Dickon.

Dr Craven smiled. “Oh, Dickon. He’s as strong as a moor pony.”

“And he’s trustworthy,” said Mary. “He’s the most trustworthy lad in Yorkshire.” she continued in a thick Yorkshire accent.

“Did Dickon teach you that?”

“I’m learning it like French. It’s like a native language in India. Clever people learn them. I like it, and so does Colin.”

“Well, well. Did you take your medicine last night, Colin?”

“No. Mary talked me to sleep about spring in a garden.”

“That sounds soothing,” said Dr Craven, glancing at Mary. “You are better, but you must remember…”

“I don’t want to remember,” Colin interrupted. “When I’m alone, I have pains and think of things that make me scream. I want a doctor who can make you forget you’re ill. My cousin makes me forget, so she makes me better.”

Dr Craven left quickly, puzzled.

“Well, sir,” Mrs Medlock asked, “could you believe it?”

“It’s certainly new, and better than before.”

“Susan Sowerby is right,” said Mrs Medlock. “I spoke to her yesterday, and she said, ‘She may not be good or pretty, but she’s a child, and children need children.’ ”

“Mrs. Sowerby's the best nurse I know,” said Dr Craven.

Mrs Medlock smiled. “She’s got a way with her. She once said, ‘The world’s like an orange, and no one owns the whole thing. Don’t grab at the whole orange, or you won’t even get the pips, and they’re bitter.’ ”

“She’s a shrewd woman,” said Dr Craven.

Colin slept well that night. He woke up smiling, thinking of the garden, Dickon, and his animals. Mary ran in.

“You’ve been out! There’s that nice smell of leaves!” Colin cried.

“It’s so beautiful!” she said. “It’s here, the Spring! Dickon says so!”

“Has it?” Colin sat up in bed.

“Open the window! Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets!”

Mary opened the window. Freshness, scents, and birdsong poured in.

“That’s fresh air,” she said. “Dickon says it makes him strong. Breathe it.”

Colin breathed deeply.

“ ‘Forever and ever’! Does it make him feel like that?” he said, and he did as she told him, drawing in long deep breaths over and over again until he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to him.

Mary described the garden: flowers, buds, green leaves, birds building nests, roses, primroses, and the seeds they planted coming up. Dickon had brought a fox, a crow, squirrels, and a newborn lamb.

The nurse came in, surprised at the open window.

“Are you sure you aren’t cold, Master Colin?”

“No. I’m breathing fresh air. I’m going to have breakfast on the sofa, with my cousin.”

Colin told the nurse, “A boy, a fox, a crow, two squirrels, and a lamb are coming to see me. I want them here. The boy is Martha’s brother, Dickon. He’s an animal charmer.”

“I hope the animals won’t bite, Master Colin,” said the nurse.

“He’s a charmer. Charmers’ animals never bite.”

They ate breakfast with the fresh air pouring in.

“You’ll get fatter, like me,” said Mary. “I never wanted breakfast in India, but now I always do.”

“I wanted mine this morning,” said Colin. “When do you think Dickon will come?”

Soon, Mary held up her hand. “Listen! Did you hear a caw?”

Colin listened. “Yes.”

“That’s Soot. Listen again! A tiny bleat?”

“Oh, yes!”

“That’s the lamb. He’s coming.”

Dickon’s boots clumped down the corridor.

“If you please, sir,” said Martha, opening the door, “here’s Dickon and his creatures.”

Dickon entered, smiling. The lamb was in his arms, the fox by his side. Nut sat on his shoulder, Soot on the other, and Shell peeked out of his pocket.

Colin stared in wonder. He hadn’t imagined Dickon would be like this, so friendly and close to his animals. He was speechless.

Dickon wasn’t shy. He put the lamb on Colin’s lap. The lamb nuzzled into Colin’s dressing-gown.

“What’s it doing?” cried Colin. “What does it want?”

“It wants its mother,” said Dickon. “I brought it a bit hungry, because I knew you’d like to see it feed.”

He knelt and took a bottle from his pocket. He fed the lamb, who sucked eagerly.

After that, questions poured forth. Dickon told them how he found the lamb.

While he talked, Soot flew around, Nut and Shell explored the trees, and Captain curled up near Dickon.

They looked at gardening books. Dickon knew all the flower names.

“I couldn’t say that name,” he said, pointing to “Aquilegia”, “but we call that a columbine. That one’s a snapdragon. They grow wild, but these are garden ones, bigger and grander. There’s some big clumps of columbine in the garden. They’ll look like butterflies when they’re out.”

“I’m going to see them!” cried Colin.

“Yes, you are,” said Mary. “And you must not lose any time about it.”
