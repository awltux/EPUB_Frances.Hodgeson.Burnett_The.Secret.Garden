## CHAPTER 12
### Might I Have a Bit of Earth?
Mary dashed to her room, breathless and pink-cheeked. Martha was waiting, dinner on the table.

"You're late," Martha said. "Where've you been?"

"I saw Dickon!" Mary exclaimed. "I saw Dickon!"

"I knew he'd come," Martha replied. "What do you think of him?"

"I think – I think he's beautiful!"

Martha seemed surprised but pleased. "He's the best lad ever, but we never thought him handsome. His nose turns up too much."

"I like it," Mary insisted.

"And his eyes are so round," Martha continued, "though they're a nice colour. Mother says it's from looking at the birds and clouds. But he has got a big mouth, hasn't he?"

"I love it," Mary said. "I wish mine was the same."

Martha laughed. "It'd look funny on you. Did you like the seeds and tools?"

"How did you know he brought them?" Mary asked.

"I knew he would. He's trusty."

Mary worried Martha might ask too many questions, but she was interested in the seeds. She asked where to plant the flowers.

"Who did you ask?" Martha wondered.

"No one yet," Mary admitted.

"Don't ask Mr. Roach, the head gardener. He's too grand. Ask Ben Weatherstaff. He's not as bad as he looks. He made Mrs. Craven laugh. She liked him. Maybe he'd find you a corner."

"If it's out of the way, no one could mind, could they?" Mary asked.

"No reason to," Martha assured her.

Mary quickly ate her dinner, but Martha stopped her as she went to find her hat.

"Mr. Craven's back," she said. "He wants to see you."

Mary paled. "He didn't want to see me before!"

"Mother met him," Martha explained. "She spoke to him about you. He remembered Mrs. Craven visited our cottage. He wants to see you before he leaves tomorrow."

"Oh, is he leaving tomorrow? I'm glad!"

"He's going for ages. Not back until autumn or winter."

"I'm so glad!" Mary repeated.

If he was away until winter, the garden could come alive.

"When will he want to see—"

Mrs. Medlock entered, dressed in her best, wearing a brooch with a picture of Mr. Medlock. She looked nervous.

"Your hair's rough," she said. "Brush it. Martha, help her change. Mr. Craven wants her in his study."

Mary's heart thumped. She became a stiff, silent child again. Once changed, she followed Mrs. Medlock, dreading the meeting.

She was led to a new part of the house. Mrs. Medlock knocked, and they entered. Mr. Craven sat by the fire.

"This is Miss Mary, sir," Mrs. Medlock announced.

"Leave her," he replied. "I'll ring when I'm done."

Mary stood twisting her hands. Mr. Craven wasn't a hunchback, but had high, crooked shoulders and greying black hair.

"Come here," he said.

Mary approached. He wasn't ugly, but miserable. He looked bothered by her presence.

"Are you well?" he asked.

"Yes," Mary replied.

"Are they taking care of you?"

"Yes."

He rubbed his forehead. "You're very thin."

"I'm getting fatter," Mary answered stiffly.

His black eyes seemed distant, lost in thought.

"I forgot you," he said. "I meant to send a governess, but I forgot."

"Please," Mary began, her throat tight, "I'm too big for a nurse. Please don't make me have a governess yet."

He rubbed his forehead again. "That's what Mrs. Sowerby said."

Mary took courage. "Is she Martha's mother?"

"Yes," he said.

"She knows about children. She has twelve."

He seemed to focus. "What do you want to do?"

"I want to play outside," Mary answered, hoping she didn't tremble. "I never liked India. I'm hungry here, and getting fatter."

He watched her. "Mrs. Sowerby thought it would do you good. She thought you should get stronger first."

"I feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor," Mary continued.

"Where do you play?" he asked.

"Everywhere," Mary gasped. "Martha's mother sent a skipping-rope. I skip and run – and look to see if things are growing. I don't do any harm."

"Don't look so frightened," he said. "You couldn't. Do what you like."

Mary put her hand to her throat. "May I?" she asked.

Her anxious face seemed to trouble him more.

"Of course," he said. "I'm your guardian, a poor one. I can't give you time. I'm ill, wretched, distracted. I want you happy. Mrs. Medlock will get you what you need. I saw you because Mrs. Sowerby said I should. Her daughter talked about you. She thought you needed air and freedom."

"She knows about children," Mary repeated.

"She should," Mr. Craven said. "She was bold to stop me, but said Mrs. Craven was kind to her. She's respectable. Now I've seen you, I think she's right. Play outside. It's big, go where you like. Anything you want? Toys, books, dolls?"

"Might I," Mary asked, "might I have a bit of earth?"

Mr. Craven looked surprised. "Earth? What do you mean?"

"To plant seeds – to make things grow – to see them come alive."

He gazed at her, passing his hand over his eyes. "Do you care about gardens so much?"

"I didn't in India. I was ill and tired, and it was too hot. I made beds in the sand and put flowers in. But it's different here."

Mr. Craven walked across the room. "A bit of earth," he said to himself. He stopped, his eyes almost soft. "You can have as much as you want. You remind me of someone who loved the earth. When you see a bit you want, take it child, and make it come alive."

"May I take it from anywhere – if it's not wanted?"

"Anywhere," he answered. "Go now, I'm tired." He rang for Mrs. Medlock. "Goodbye. I'll be away all summer."

Mrs. Medlock came quickly.

"Mrs. Medlock," Mr. Craven said, "I understand Mrs. Sowerby. She must get less delicate before lessons. Give her healthy food. Let her run wild in the garden. Don't look after her too much. She needs liberty. Mrs. Sowerby can visit, and she may go to the cottage."

Mrs. Medlock was pleased not to have to look after Mary as much, and she liked Martha's mother.

"Thank you, sir," she said. "Susan Sowerby and I went to school together. She's sensible and good-hearted. I'd take her advice. She's healthy-minded."

"I understand," Mr. Craven answered. "Take Miss Mary away. Send Pitcher."

Mary flew to her room. Martha was waiting.

"I can have my garden!" Mary cried. "Anywhere I like! No governess for ages! Your mother's coming, and I can go to your cottage! He says I can't do any harm, and I may do what I like – anywhere!"

"Eh!" Martha said, delighted. "That was nice."

"Martha," Mary said, "he's really nice, but his face is miserable."

She ran to the garden. She'd been away longer than she intended, and Dickon would have left. The tools were under a tree. She looked around, but Dickon was gone. The garden was empty, save for the robin.

"He's gone," she said sadly. "Was he only a wood fairy?"

Something white caught her eye, fastened to a rosebush. It was a piece of her letter to Dickon. On it were letters and a picture of a nest with a bird. Underneath: "I will cum bak."
