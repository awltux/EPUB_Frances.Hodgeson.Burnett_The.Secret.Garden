## CHAPTER 8
### The Robin Who Showed the Way
Mary examined the key, turning it over in her hands. She wasn't one to ask permission. If it unlocked the closed garden, she'd find the door and see what lay within. It had been locked for ten years; something strange must have happened to it. If she liked it, she could escape there, play alone, and no one would know where she was. The thought pleased her greatly.

Living alone in a house with so many locked rooms had stirred her imagination. The fresh moor air had given her an appetite and energy and awakened her mind. In India, she'd been too hot and tired to care about anything. Now, she wanted to do things. She felt less grumpy, though she didn't know why.

She put the key in her pocket and walked along the garden path. No one ever came here. She looked at the ivy-covered wall, trying to find the door. But the leaves were too thick. Annoyed, she walked back to the house, resolving to carry the key always, ready for when she found the hidden door.

The next morning, Martha returned, her cheeks red and full of cheer. She'd woken early, enjoying the sunrise and the animals on the moor. A man had given her a ride in his cart. She told Mary about her visit home, how she and her mother had baked and washed. She'd made dough-cakes for her siblings, who had shouted with joy at the treat. Her brother, Dickon, thought their cottage was fit for a king.

Martha told Mary's story by the fire, how she was waited on by servants and didn't know how to dress herself. Her family were very interested in Mary's life. Mary considered this. She'd tell Martha more stories so her family would be entertained. She said she could tell them about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers going to hunt tigers. Martha was thrilled. She said it was like a wild beast show.

Mary thought about how different India was from Yorkshire. Martha's mother was worried about Mary being alone and suggested Martha cheer her up. Mary was grateful, and said she liked to hear Martha talk.

Martha returned with a surprise hidden under her apron. It was a skipping rope with red and blue handles. A travelling salesman had passed their cottage, and Martha's mother had used her wages to buy the rope for Mary. Mary had never seen one before and asked what it was for. Martha, surprised, showed her how to skip, jumping and counting until she reached a hundred.

Mary was excited and asked if she could try. Martha encouraged her, saying it would give her strength. Mary tried skipping but wasn't very good at it. Martha told her to go outside and play, even if it rained a bit. Mary thanked Martha for the gift, awkwardly. Martha laughed, and said if she had been her sister she would have kissed her. Martha told her to run off and play with the rope.

Mary felt awkward but went outside with the rope. She skipped and counted until her cheeks were red, more interested than she'd ever been. The sun was shining, and the wind carried the scent of fresh earth. She skipped around the gardens and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging, talking to his robin.

She skipped towards him, and he looked up in surprise. He exclaimed, surprised that she could be so lively. He had thought she was an old woman. Mary told him she'd never skipped before and could only reach twenty. Ben encouraged her to continue, noting how the robin was watching her, curious about the skipping rope.

Mary skipped all around the gardens, resting often. She decided to skip the length of her special walk. She grew hot and breathless before she reached the end, but she had counted to thirty. Laughing, she saw the robin perched on a branch of ivy. She remembered the key in her pocket striking her with each jump and laughed again.

"You showed me where the key was yesterday," she said. "You ought to show me the door today, but I don't believe you know!"

The robin flew to the top of the wall and sang a loud, lovely song. Mary thought of the magic in her servant's stories. Just then, a strong gust of wind blew down the path, swaying the ivy on the wall. Mary saw something beneath the leaves: a round knob. It was the knob of a door!

Her heart pounding, she pulled the ivy aside. It was the lock of the door, closed for ten years. She took out the key, put it in the lock, and turned. It took both hands, but it turned.

She looked back to see if anyone was coming. No one was. She held back the ivy, pushed the door, and it opened slowly. She slipped through, shut the door behind her, and stood with her back against it.

She was standing inside the secret garden.
